The shoe was poorly made. I love sketchers so I thought this would be great. I was very disappointed. The tie around the center strap unravelled the first time I wore it.
Bought them especially to wear on vacation where I would be doing a lot of walking. They felt wonderful!
I am very disappointed with these shoes. They look so comfortable but thet ended up killing my feet after an 8 hour work day. Sadly, I do not recommend these shoes!
Love them...great style and great comfort!!
These sandals are fantastic! They are so super comfortable, I could wear them all day! Last summer I started suffering from planters fasciitis from wearing unsupportive flip flops. I am a flip flop kinda girl and was so disappointed when I had to stop wearing them. This spring I bought these skechers sandals and I haven't had any issues with pain in my feet! I am so so happy with how comfy and cute they are; I get compliments all time. Do not hesitate to buy these sandals!
Better then I expected!  They're really really comfortable. The size is right, not to larger or to small. Easy to put on.
These are my new favorite shoes!  They are so comfy.  The don't have quite the arch support some shoes do, but, otherwise are so comfortable.  I can hike around in them all day and my feet don't hurt at all.  Sometimes I can wear a half size smaller in sandals, and I most definitely could not in these, so be sure you order the size you wear in tennis.<br />I would recommend these to anyone.  In fact, I have two friends that tried mine and bought a pair the next day!
The length was fine just the straps are a bit tight. Still comfy shoes though.
I seldom wear open toe shoes.  This are great and very comfortable.
Love them.  Quieter than flip flops. Comfortable between toes.
Super comfortable, wear these all the time! Definitely worth the price!
Great when new unfortunately they stretched over time with moderate wear.
OK!!
Perfect for me. I recently have developed bunions and anything with a strap or enclosed shoe hurts so I need something that does not have a strap in a sandal over the knuckle of the big toe and these shoes are perfect for that purpose. They are really comfortable and I have had many compliments on them. The price is a little high for some reason, but, I was desperate. If the price was lower I would have bought several pairs.
Satisfied with purchase.
I have these in grey also.  They feel like you have your slippers on but are are sturdy enough to walk long distances.
I wish the soles provided more support, the balls of the feet fully flatten and I'm not a very big person. That said the upper part is super comfy and I haven't had any of the stretching out issues others have complained of. If they beefed up the bottom sole this would be a 5* product.
Not worth buying, I thought they would work well for my swollen feet - wrong.  Made my feet look like little sumo wrestlers...and the rubber bands inside the are tight.
I didn't think I'd like these shoes at first because it was a bit involved to get them on.  I've figured it out, though, and while it's not as simple as just slipping into them like you would a regular flip flop, it really isn't that big a deal.  I'm retired, so I don't wear them all day, but I've worn them for several hours at a time and never have I had any discomfort.  They are soft and cushy, and are now my favorite summer shoe.  I've gotten two more pairs in different colors and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them.
Comfy
I have had these shoes for a few months.  I loved them when I first got them and would have given 5 stars.  But after wearing them for a few months the elastic has stretched and they are now difficult to keep on my feet and rub a blister on the bottom of my foot because there is so much movement in the sandal.  If only wearing them for something I know that will not involve a lot of walking they are ok, but if going to be any distance and lots of walking they are not ideal.
I like them as much or more than the sanuks I have
SUPER comfortable!!
A pain to put on. Did not like
I love these shoes! They are so comfortable and super cute!
Love skechers. I should buy stock! These are super comfortable. I also have a teal pair.  Didn't expect them to have arch support. Basically flip-flops which rarely have arch support.
great shoes-- maybe not not for a long hike but they are both comfortable and chic and need no breaking in. Hint: to  prepare them for putting them on, pull the bigger loop  that is attached to the thong back  toward the heel and under  the smaller loop.
Great looking and comfortable.
Need half sizes
cool and comfy
Just loooove them. They fit perfect and they look amazing.
Embarrassed to say but lately skechers are almost all I wear.  I love these!
Cool and comfortable
This shoes are so comfy. I have bought two pair, I wish I could find more colors in my size.
Great shoe. Only complaint is the top strap that goes over is binding. I can't wear them long because it cuts into my foot. Overall a great shoe tho
Flip-flops are against my office dress code, unless they have a heel strap. These totally fit the bill.  They are comfortable and the fabric is pretty stretchy.  They have been my go to shoes the past few weeks,  Like any flip flop I don't feel like they would be great for walking long distances, but for short errands and sitting at desk all day they are perfect.  They fit just fine, but I've never had a problem with the fit of Skechers so I got my usual size.  The only thing I don't like about them is they do slide a bit when driving since the fabric is strecchy
very,very comfortable !!
Cute with dress that matches I also got from amazon
Most comfortable flip flop I have ever worn! By far!
Very comfortable.  Love the heel strap and material that doesn't make my toe sore.
I have been trying to find a pair of shoes like this for my ever expanding feet (pregnant), I have tried these and two different styles by Sanuk with no luck.<br />I prefer the footbed on these over the Sanuks, but Sanuk has better fabric. These are like swimsuit material in comparison to the stretchy cotton fabric of Sanuk.<br />I probably would have still kept these, but the elastic in the top band was so tight that it hurt and left deep grooves in my foot after just trying them on.
I find these shoes to be quite comfortable, and that is indeed a major find as I have suffered from plantar fasci itis for the last year.  I wore them all day yesterday and had little to no discomfort.  I hope to find some more Skechers yoga slings soon.  They were for sure an excellent purchase and I will hopefully soon be the proud owner of a second pair.
Great product
I am so in love with these sandals I ordered a pair in another color.
These could have better arch support but overall are comfy, I like these much better than the Sanuk version they seem to fit better, you don't want too much extra toe room with shoes like this.....could be dangerous.
Love the way they fit. Just wish they were a tad snugger.
Normally can't wear thongs, tried these and quite comfortable. I have high arches and the yoga mat conform s nicely.  Fabric between the toes soft and flexible, no irritation like I usually get from thongs.
Awesome sandals that I can wear and enjoy....finally. I have Morton's Neuroma in my feet and have only been able to wear Keen and Birkenstock sandals. But now I hAve another shoe I can wear; even the cloth between my toes is tolerable. The footboard is nice and thick and after a few times of wear conform to the shape of my feet. Wow....like walking on air.
These are the most comfortable shoes. I can wear them all day and my feet don't hurt. I have them in every color. I highly recommend them!
the most comfortable sandals I have ever had...I need to buy more in different colors.
My hairdresser had on a pair of these.  I loved the look.  She told me they were super comfortable.  I came home, looked them up on Amazon and they came in two days.  Very comfortable.
I have very sensitive feet and have avoided flip flops because I didn't want anything between my toes.  These are amazingly comfortable.  The strap between the toes is soft and the rest of the straps are elastic encased in a very soft fabric.  Because of the elastic, these just conform to your foot.  And the yoga mat bottom is really cushy.  I put them on and have happy feet.  I would definitely buy these again.
Tricky apparatus. Must be a genius to figure it out. No problem here.
My daughter loves these! Not bulky looking in person. So comfortable!
My daughter loves these! Also bought another color. So comfortable and not bulky in person. Colors on this multi are softer in person.
I returned these, after wearing 2 times, the material became saggy and did not hold your feet into place, my heel was falling off the back of the shoe. The material feels nice but but very cheap, and started ripping at every seem...wont order again!
GOT 2 PAIR,,LIKE WALKING ON AIR
I saw these on a friend and bought a pair for myself.  They are basically glorified flip flops, flip flops with a back strap.  They are comfortable for a few hours of solid walking.  After about 3 hours, the top strap, which is fabric covering a thin, tight elastic, started to dig into the top of my foot.  Mind you, I walked 60 miles the week I discovered this (on vacation).  These are not 10 mile a day shoes so that is partly my fault.<br /><br />My 1 star off comes from the fact that the black tie you see in between the toes is a mere short black tie and on the left sandal, it fell off after day 2.
They are flip flops so do not expect great support. They are wonderfully comfortable and I do wear them for errands and walking short distances. Like any other flip flop wearing them longer than a couple of hours tires the foot. I wear an 8 wide shoe but find these fit just fine. I would recommend these as a stylish,comfortable alternative to plain flip flops. Because of the fabric top I would say do not wear them around water.
I love these shoes!!!! They are so comfortable and cute. I wear them almost everyday. I have the grey color as well. Great shoe to wear to yoga class or just running around doing errands
Soooo comfortable!
I really love these sandals. Easy to put on and wear all day and they stay on unlike flip flops that slide off easily.
These shoes are wonderful. I have large wide feet and they fit perfectly. I wear a size 10 and not all 10s fit but these are perfect. I haven't worn them for hours at a time yet but I think they would be very comfortable no matter how long you wear them. You can barely feel the straps around your foot, it's almost like wearing a funny sock.
OMG, these are simple heaven in Footwear!!  I have these and the Sanuk brand, and I think these are even MORE comfortable.  I recently went on a trip to Vegas and we walked extensively. The first day my 'walking' shoes were killing me by the end of the day. The next day, I wore these and had discomfort whatsoever!!!  Seriously! I wore them the rest of the trip.<br /><br />These will be in my travel bag on every trip!
So comfy and stylish! Will have in each color!
Nice comfortable shoe. I am a standard 8 and ordered an 8.  Fit is true to size.  Looks really good on foot.
I bought these because I have neuropathy, not only are the insoles super soft but the bottom soles are hard for support. The soft straps are comfortable with no pinching and the heel strap keeps them on my feet when walking. They are not as soft as Sanuk Yoga brand but definitely comparable for the price!
Best shoe ever. A must buy.
It's comfortable for walking short distances but not for day-long wearing. Because they don't hold your feet still relatively to the shoes, the bottom of my feet rubbed against the shoes constantly and eventually gave me blisters.
So comfy! I am so glad I purchased them. I wish all my shoes were this comfortable!
I love these! These are better than Sanuk, which I really liked until I tried these. These have a thicker sole, which gives more support
Love them!!
I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and anything that is comfortable I am all about it. I would recommend these!
Love these sandals!!! You get not only great comfort with them, but they look great on too! They fit amazingly well and the fit is also true to size. They are affordable as well. I loved them so much I purchased a pair in black and teal.
To tight. Make it hard to walk in.
After a month of occasional use the foot bed is starting to wear down and is pilling. Disappointing because they are so comfortable I was hoping to get a lot of wear out of them.
Just a touch smaller than I'd like, as reported by other reviewers (not sure why I thought my feet would be different :/). think I just need to get used to the feel of the thong style of these sandals. Really want them to be as comfortable as they look...
These are great! I wore them all day long and they were very comfortable! I might have to order another pair in a different color!
I bought 2 pair. 1 rasberry and 1 on grey both size 9. I love them. Very comfy except for the grey pair elastic is a bit tighter and throughout day its a little sore. But the rasberry color fits perfect. I got these shoes because of my back of feet hurt with other types of sandals with backs.
Love them!!
Great
The flip flops are very comfortable and fit great
I am going to get another pair they are so cute and comfy!! I had major back surgery a couple years back and boy let me tell you and the end of the day these shoes make a HUGE difference I hope I can get another pair in white any color that goes with almost anything like these I got black and I got a size 9 true to size I have wide feet and they swell NOT WITH THESE THEY DONT!! Miracle shoes :)  recommend to anyone who is in pain like me!
These sandals are pretty, lightweight, and comfortable. It's like walking on air. I will definitely have to get other colors. And the straps feel so soft, as if you have nothing on your feet.
Love these shoes !
Love they way they look, but not as comfortable as they look. I should have ordered a half size up, not down. The lack of contour or support in the sole make they hard on the back after a short time.
Comfortable and cute.  Me feet tended to go toward the side in the beginning but as I wore them, it straightened out.
beautiful and comfortable
These shoes are more stylish than ordinary flip/flops or whatever you want to call them.  Very comfortable.
good service  good fit
These sandals by Skechers are so comfortable I had to get them in two different colors to wear with everything.
These are cute and comfy.  I use them in the house (I don't like to go barefoot).  I can wear them all day comfortably.
The fabric is soft and the toe area doesn't rub/cause blisters like other sandals. I got these to wear with a large brace, and its the only thing I can wear with it since I'm very picky about how shoes fit. They don't flop around. For my brace I went about half a size up, but it fits wide feet and any height or shape with a nice stretch without being loose, the size mostly just changes the footbed length. Both my feet fit in these though the brace adds a significant amount of bulk and my other foot is tiny.
Very comfortable flip flop. I have difficulty walking and could never wear flip flops, but these stay on and are perfect for beach, pool, street and house. Purchased two pairs, one to wear around the house and pool and one to wear out. They provide good support and look smart. Wish they offered the multicolor and other colors in my size, 9. I wish they also came in men's sizes as I think they would look just as good on men and wanted to get one for my husband to use at pool, etc.
Very comfortable!  Love them
I love them, bought 3 pair!!
Love them!  Very comfy and look so cute!
Cute and comfy. Sole has some contour for comfort and stability. Sanuk version has flat sole that tends to flop when you walk. Wear size 9.5 and bought a 9. Length is just barely Ok. Figured 10 would be too long. Overall I like the sandals.
Usually a 7.5 I expected the shoe to be a bit big. While not a great orthopedic shoe, they are about 20 steps up from a basic flip flop or hard bottom sandal. The center strap is crucial to supporting the foot but the material may make it slip a bit. Anyway very comfortable and a great summer shoe alternative to plain flip flops or cheap sandals.
These are perfect for wide feet . No awkward rub spots . Comfy !
I love my new sandals they're so amazingly comfortable! I recommend if you're a 1/2 size up for example a 7 1/2, go with an 8. You will love these sandals!
Love these!
My wife was pleased. I was happy. It was all GOOD!!!
Fit great, although my foot slips off to the side a little
Very comfortable! Love them.
Love them~ Perfect and so comfortable.
Literally the first pair of actual flip flops that I can wear because I can't stand anything between my toe, however the part between your toe is so soft they don't bother me at all. Very light weight and comfortable.  You can hardly tell you have shoes on.  Although they are soft and squishy, there is no arch support and can only wear for short periods, not an all day shoe.
They are comfortable shoes that are super cute!
I bought for the straps, these are comfortable sandals.  I do not think I would buy them for arch support.  These sandals for me are casual.
Has slightly more heel than my other yoga sandals. The elastic is a little tighter and more noticeable than the others also. But still comfortable and stay on my feet, whuch is a problem with backless flip flops.
Fit comfortably and provide more support than other sandals.
Loved them!
Great summer sandal. Very comfortable and does not make noise like a flip flop.
The arch support isn't really defined, but the sole of the shoe/sandal conforms to the foot, making them very nice to wear.
These shoes were purchased for my wife.  She is very happy with them, so much so she had me order a second pair.  She has never been fully satisfied any flip-flop style shoe in the past.  She thinks these shoes are fantastic.
Feel great on but not sure if the material will stretch out and make the shoes too loose. Got a compliment on them the first day. If they don't stretch too much I would get another color too..
Soft, squishy and they fit really well. Not the best for support, but they are great to wear all day and stay relatively snug on your feet.
The straps stretch out terribly it was actually a dangerous shoe for me. The shoe caught on a throw rug my foot went forward and the straps went with my foot but the bottom stayed under the throw rug:/mat and I almost took a header. Sent them back all three pair. Bought the other brand that looks like these and they are great the straps do not allow this to happen.
Love them! Very very comfy!
Love it
Very comfortable shoes! The straps stay on the back perfectly. My only issues is that with the lack of a nice arch support, my feet turn inward. However, I think most of that is due to way my feet are, not the make of the shoe.
Love them!!!! Im a size 9 and they are perfect. Very comfortable especially because i have problems with my heels. Plan on buying same in teal.
Perfect and so very comfortable!!!
These fit and are comfortable when sitting and standing, but often when I'm walking my feet slide inwards and I'm walking on the edge of the sandal. They're good enough that I will keep them but probably wouldn't buy again
Very cute and comfortable!!
I love the shoes but I was unable to wear them because of no arch support.  Gave them to my daughter and she just loves them (thus the 4 stars).  They were received when promised.  I would definitely do business with seller again.
I love these shoes !! I want them in different colors
Comfy with a lot of cushion
love them and the wierd A shapes they leave on my feet :)
Very comfy!!
These are so comfortable and look great.  I love casual, comfy clothes, and these go with everything.
perfect  5 star
Very very comfortable.  Just wish sole didn't flatten out so fast.
I luv them. They're so comfortable
very comfortable for all day wear
These are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn in my life! I've already ordered a 2nd backup pair invade anything happens to these. LOVE THEM!
loved them
i do like them, they are soft.
My daughter wore these about 5 times when the string wrapped around the thong came unraveled. I'm very disappointed. She's had Skecher sneakers in the past that wore well, so I'm surprised and will not be buying Skechers again.  Update: And I discovered that I missed the return date by 1 day, so I'm stuck with shoes that can't be worn. Very poor quality and poor customer service.
Very pleased.  They are comfortable!
I have bought sketchers for years.  Don't  like these at all.  Very disappointed this time.
Great fit, extremely comfortable.
Lovely summer shoe, US9 fit as expected
Absolutely love these!  Had to buy a second pair!  Extremely comfortable!
I absolutely love these sandles!
Love, love, love these flip flops.  Super comfy, they really do have the &#34;yoga mat&#34; feel to the soles, and unlike most of the between-the-toe type flip flops, these do not rub and chafe after a while.  I can wear them all day and walk long distances in them no problem.  Because the elastic that holds them on to your feet is very flexible, it will probably fit most feet no problem.  While they are technically too casual for the workplace, I'm wearing them anyway.  They are too comfy to pass up for more formal and restrictive shoes.
Love these! Just as good as Sanuks and very comfortable.
Love the comfort
Very light and comfortable
The strap for the toe needs to be centered better. It forces my big toe off the platform.
Super comfortable and great looking sandals. I love how these are snug so that I can walk without having to crunch my toes to keep them on. I do wonder though if wearing them for long periods will have cause discomfort from the pressure of the elastics under the fabric. They do seem to press the foot into the thong. With that said, I am looking forward to putting a few miles on them walking the beaches and town of Key West, FL.
Perfect fit and most comfortable sandal ever!! Usually the piece between the toes is uncomfortable, but not with these sandals. Love them!!
I wanted some summery shoes for my casual work with out the flip flop noise, these are perfect!
I Love my Skechers Cali Women's Meditaion-Slingback yoga Sandals.
They are awesome! only thing that would make them better is if they had some arch support!
Oh my Lord...these are THE most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! I want them in every color...and maybe another pair in black just in case... ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
Absolutely love them would like to buy another pair !!!  And so comfortable!!!
These are very comfortable...I love the look and feel of the shoes..I have to get another pair in a different color.
I have not wore them yet. Not warm enough. They feel like soft marshmallows! Very soft straps as well. Can't go wrong with Skechers.
They're a flip flop without the flop. Super comfortable, but of course little or no arch support. I love that they have the two bands to keep them snug against my foot. Gave four stars because no arch support, not even a little rise in the sole in that area.
Best thing since apple pie! Nice fit, ready to wear, no breaking in needed, soft and very comfortable! Nice colors but wish they had white!! This will be my everyday shoe and will have tp buy another color!!
fits as expected. They're very comfy but they really warm up my feet. Its a little strange.
I love them, they are soooooooo comfortable and stylish.  I have received good comments on them.  Thanks for such a lovely and comfortable shoes and the price was just right.
So cute! Fast shipping. They are as pictured. They feel great. I just wish they had half sizes. However, I'll probably buy another pair!
Love them - sooooooo comfortable. Bottom is made of &#34;yoga mat&#34; material, and sure feels like it!!!!
SO soft!  I have plantar fibrosa.  These cushion my feet so well that it cushions the fibromas on the bottom of my feet.
Very comfortable!  I am used to slip on flip flops, so these took some getting used to. Now I love them!
Very comfortable and looks good too.
Love these super cute and comfortable shoes!
I haven't got the chance to wear them yet. But when I tried them on they felt comfortable so cant wait til the weather allows sandals to be worn....
LOVE UM!!
Loved the shoe at first, but after a short time wearing them, I could feel a hard round disk at the base of the thong between the toes. Because the sole of the shoe is so soft, it only made it more pronounced for me. Sorry to have to send them back.
Very comfortable!!  I had to buy another pair because I know I will wear them out.
Great yoga shoes.  Just like flip flop with support in the back, so it won't fall off.  Definitely a must have.  It's very comfortable.
So so comfy! My new fave.
Happy with the fit and the style. I will be ordering other colors soon.
Love love love my new shoes
Very comfortable and stylish.  I was going to purchase the same type and style shoe by another brand, however these were more affordable and am I ever glad I bought them!  I work in a special education classroom all day and am not allowed to wear sneakers and this is a nice alternative!
I wore these for the first time for a full day out on vacation. For a few minutes, I thought that the knot at the front was bothering my foot, but that quickly went away and hasn't bothered me since. I ordered these in a size 11 and they fit perfectly, though they do not look quite as cute as they looked in the commercial where I saw them. I suspect the straps will fall in different place on different people's feet depending on the width, shape, etc. Overall, I really like them and I find them super comfortable. The only thing, and this is really minor, is that you really can't slip these shoes on. Because the straps are soft fabric, you really have to sit down to get them on correctly. Otherwise, I really like them!
SO COMFORTABLE!!! I have gotten so many compliments on them, as well. Every time I wear them, people say, &#34;I love those sandals! They look like they would be perfect for (insert verb here).&#34; From walking to class to walking around the mall or even walking my dog, I would definitely recommend these. Plus, the straps are also silky soft, so they never rub!! You have comfort from the soles, comfort from the straps, and everyone will compliment you :) They are a GREAT buy! Perfect for summer~
Stylish, trendy, and very comfortable.
These flip flops are wonderful.  So comfortable.  I have been looking for flip flops or sandals that I can wear to Disney World that are cute and comfortable.  These should do the trick.  I walked 7 miles today and they still felt great.  Feels like you are stepping on a yoga mat.
Love love love this shoe.  I may have to get another color.  Goes with everything. Pirates to casual to dressy.  Soooooooooooo comfortable.  Wonderful fit.
Love them
Love the shoe I bought 2 pair
Comfortable from day one but seem to be flattening quickly after just a few wearings
I can wear these shoes for a while...the arch support is okay....  I wouldn't be wearing these all day anyway.  They are interesting as my foot seems to glide off the shoes toward the outside of the shoe.  These are the only ones that that happens??<br />They are comfortable and made well.  I am keeping them.
I'm not big on sandals, usually if I have somewhere to go quick in good weather I slip on flip flops, but they offer terrible support, so I tried these. It's not warm enough to wear here in NY yet but I put them on and wore them for a couple of hours indoors and they are great! I wear an 8 1/2 wide, but they didn't offer in wide so I do what I always do, go up to a 9. These fit well, have extra width so I could have gone for an 8 1/2 normal.
Very floppy, slips to the side of foot and out of sandal sideways.  Would never buy these again.
I like them even though they are a touch small, but my guess is that they will stretch out like my Sanuks did. If not I will try a size larger next time. I like the thick sole and the less expensive price.
Very comfy!
These yoga flip flops are quite comfortable.  The fabric construction makes them very easy to put on/take off and there's NO friction/pain with the thong between your toes, which is great for those who tend to avoid wearing thongs for this reason.  There really is no arch support to speak of since, after all, they are considered flip flops and what flip flops usually have any arch support to them.  The sole is cushiony and I have worn them for several hours at a time around the house.  You can likely run errands with them, but I don't recommend them for any long range walking or walking about on uneven or stoney ground because I believe the sole will likely break down over time.  For after yoga or light &#34;around town&#34; or &#34;around the house&#34; wear they're terrific.
I have not worn these flip flops much yet, but they appear to be very comfortable and with the back they provide good support so they are easy to walk in.  I hope the material does not stretch with wear, as that would eliminate the support.  Right now, I think they are &#34;super&#34;!  Sketchers brand always seems consistent with their sizing.
I can't wait to wear these all day! Skechers has done it again...these are amazing!!! SO comfy, even the straps!
Highly recommend!  LOVE these sandals.  I tried these and Sanuk.  Returned Sanuk because the soles were too rigid and made flip flop sound and probably would get stretched out because of that.  I walked all day in San Fran, up and down the Golden Gate Bridge, up to some lookout points and more.  No tired or sore feet . . just dirty.  I hope I can wash them.  I wish Sketchers had the color selection that Sanuk offers.
I love these shoes!  Super comfy  - normally wear a size 9 - but the 10 looks and felt better<br />I also bought the gray pair.  Super excited to get lots of wear out of them!
Like. Fit great. Wear lots.
Cute and comfortable. I don't tend to walk around in them for long periods of time, but Skechers sandals became an instant favorite after trying them for the first time a couple of years ago, and this pair did not disappoint. Best part is they look great with a pair of capris or you could wear them with a cute sundress. Pretty versatile. I would purchase them again.
They're quite gorgeous, and reasonably comfortable, but the &#34;yoga mat soles&#34;, while squishy and nice for short distances, offer no support and aren't suitable for more than a leisurely trip through Target. Also, they are conforming to my feet, which sounds good, but really means the spots where my weight hits heaviest has the least cushioning bc it's permanently squished down.
Somewhat small and the top covering is scratchy so not for long extended wear - to gym and back but walking around school campus was a little uncomforyable
They look good and feel good. Nice fit.
They're just as described ,but the material of  the straps allows them to strech! But they wear good.
The best flip flops I have ever owned! So cute but sooo comfortable!!!
Very cute unique pattern and comfy!
I was disappointed in these &#34;yoga-mat&#34; flip flops.  A few years ago I had two pairs of Sketchers &#34;Walk Fit&#34; flip-flop style sandals and they were the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn.  I wore one pair daily on a vacation and they were awesome.  I'd hoped these were similar, but they are not.  They are also very loose-fitting, and I have wide feet, so someone with narrow feet would not be able to wear them at all.
Great fit! Love these sandals!
I suffer from plantar fasciitis. Making very difficult for shoes to fit comfortably. But with these  yoga foam flip flops, my foot conforms to the shoe as memory foam. They do not have arch support,but with feet conforming it's like a good arch support shoe. These are the only flip flops I can wear that does not hurt my feet. Will buy again.
Cute, a little loose for my foot but added a toe grip to assist.
Look great but feel sloppy when I walk in them .
Comfortable and sporty at the same time.  I like them.
comfortable to walk in
They fit well and are very comfortable.
First of all.. I have wide feet.. So reviewing them.. Even with my wide feet, I found them rather large. They slip a bit when I walk. I have purchased several pairs of these but the earlier models have more of a foam/egg crate style. They were so much better then these. I have acchillis(so?) And plantar issues and need shoes with a bit of a lift and a lot of support. The older styles of these sandals were excellent and I had no issues at all with my feet for 2 years. I replaces them because one tore and wearing these, I have sore feet and back anytime I wear them. My heels are paying for them. I wish I could return them however I just started wearing them a couple weeks ago, and the return window has closed. Too bad. Because now they are a waste of money. Go back to the normal style.. They were so much better.
Love em
Great flip flops!
Very comfortable a little expensive.  I found them elsewhere but, they didn't have my size
I got these shoes for a friend. She said she really likes them. She can't wear a lot of shoes because of some problems she has with her feet, but said these shoes feel good because of the Yoga foam foot bed.
Wowee!! You guys are right! These shoes are awesome! Very very comfy. A tad on the small side, but I love them! As cute as they are comfy!
Te shoes squeak when I walk.
Great product. Had some last year had to get a new pair because I liked them so well!!
Very cute and comfy
I really like these! I don't think you can go wrong with Skechers though! They're extremely comfortable and I love the color!
Kind of disappointed with the shoes. Thought they would be soft and fit better. I will use them but I won't order online for shoes
These are pretty comfy.  They're replacing a pair of Skechers similar to this.  I had them for about 5 years, these ones don't seem as sturdy.
Wife loves her new summer flip flops! The yoga mat style cushion is very comfy! Great summers kick abouts!
Bought another brand earlier in the season, but Sketchers beats the competition hands down. These are Great.
I am in live with these Sandals. I plan to purchase another pair for myself as well as for my sister.
These are my favourite shoes.  I had a pair from a few years back that had totally worn away on the sole.  I was overjoyed to find these as they were my favourite shoe!  These arrived in great shape with original tags, ready to wear! I was NOT disappointed in any way!
These shoes seemed to run true to size (if not slightly big).  There were well made and cute but I stop short of keeping them.  They were just a little too &#34;hunky&#34; to be a feminine sandal for my liking.  If you are looking for something that is UBER comfy for all day wear, these would be great.  I was just hoping for a little bit of a &#34;lighter&#34; and more girly appearance.
Sketchers makes the best and most comfortable wedges. Absolutely love the shoes!!!
I am a 61/2 so I bought the 7. They are a little snug now but I think the braided band will loosen a bit in time and be perfect.
Fits a bit too wide over the arch, otherwise a great sandal
These sandals will be great for travel. They are just high enough not to look frumpy but not so high that you can't walk far in them. The straps are covered on the inside with fabric so no chance of blisters. Great idea!
I actually ended up returning these because the sandal looks very chunky on my foot, and not in a good way.  Just too much shoe for a sandal.  It was very disappointing because the pics look very cute!
Very comfortable and stylish too!
This sandal is very comfortable. The color is a rich brown. Highly recommended!
Im a great fan of skechers but not this one...the straps are too wide and it looks chunky..it actually looks nice in the picture but not on my feet..I returned it
Very sexy and very comfy!

Good
The top strap was far too big for my foot. Not good for &#34;skinny&#34; feet.
I love the shoes they're cute and the memory foam is super comfortable on the bottom of your feet. The only problem I had was walking in them for a long period of time i got major blisters on my toes from the front part of the toe opening running on them it's really hard.
So comfortable, and love that my sandals don't smell with the new product for the soles , walked in them all day no rubbing or slipping
Cute shoe but doesn't come in half sizes so it is too big :(
Comfortable and cute... Bought them for an upcoming cruise!
Comf8rtable but the white band stands out too much
Love them extremely comfortable can be wear with casual or dress up.  Great brand great shoes
These are very pretty shoes.  Fit a bit snug on the top strap across your foot.
too narrow for my wide feet
I just love the shoes too.  I ordered my correct size and they should fit comfortably, but my toes hang off the sides and my heel off the back. If I get the next size up 10, it will be too large, and there are no half sizes.  The are so cute.... What am I to do
I love the look, style & colors of this shoe, but it's about 1/4 inch too big.  For me, these are comfortable for about half a day, but not all day.  I sometimes have to wear additional support (dancer gel pads) due to foot surgery, so I can't even wear flip-flops comfortably ALL day.  If I could have ordered a Size 7.5 (not available), it would have provided better arch support, longer comfort.  I love these for short social occasions or half-day events.
OMG ! Sketchers has come a long way, these sandals are sooooo cute and comfortable,<br />when you have cute and comfortable in a sandal, it's a winner :)<br />I bought them in the black and white and in the tan and gray.
Very comfy and stylish...I wear them with .... almost everything. .
This is the first pair of skechers I've purchased.  They fit okay, but seem to run a bit small, maybe order up 1/2 size or even a whole size.  These shoes are very comfortable. I ordered another pair of skecher sandals after this one and had to return them because they were too small.
Super cute, although the straps are a bit loose. They could be tighter and then it'd be 5 stars
Comfortable and look great!!
Fit perfectly. The memory foam is so comfortable. They are exactly as described. Just what I was looking for.
I love these I have serious foot issues yet I can wear these for hours comfortably.
These are super comfy!  They do have a couple spots that rub when walking long distances in the heat; however, none of the spots are too terrible.  Great shoe for a great price
Love them, sketchers never fails to not be awesome.
I love these!!!! Sooooo comfy and super cute!
love these...run just a tad bit big
these shoes run big so within the first hour of wearing them I had a blister on my toe.  I wish I could have returned them but my sister has a bigger foot so I'm giving them to her. (so I'm out the money and shipping and still in need of brown shoes).
Love the shoe style and they are comfortable, but one shoe was a little wider than the other.
Very comfortable
I wanted to love. the sole was very soft and cushioned. They probably could be worn comfortably all day. However, my toes went right out the front and I hated that so back they went.
Comfortable inspite being somewhat small
I have bought Skechers before and I realize that they run a little large, so I order a 1/2 size down.  These are extremely comfortable and look so sexy too!
Love them very comfy and elegant<br />They fit perfect
Just ordered and wore these shoes for an outdoor wedding. Fit great, very comfortable and stable on grassy areas. Cannot wait to wear them to other events!!
Total comfort
Love these sandals! I normally wear a 7 1/2 and the size 7 fit perfectly. These shoes are so much prettier in person . They are different than anything I own being that I am rather conservative.they are so comfortable and really sparkle. I bought them in black and loved them so much I came back for the taupe.
Great buy!  Very lightweight and comfortable.
They were better than expected! Comfortable memory foam makes you feel happy walking in them and I danced all night.
The top strap was far too big for my foot. Not good for &#34;skinny&#34; feet.
These shoes are really cute and stylish. I like the Sketcher's brand shoes. They are very comfortable for the height of the heel. I bought the size 7 - I usually wear a 7 1/2 but reading the reviews I went down instead of up a size and they fit perfectly.
Very comfortable, heel height is perfect, love them so much I bought another color
Beautiful
Nice
LOVE THESE!!  So shimmery and fun!
Love these and they will make any outfit look fabulous.
Larger than expected and the straps were a little too &#34;heavy&#34; looking. Not a very feminine or flattering wedge. My BF actually looked down and said &#34;no, those look like orthopedic shoes.&#34;
Perfect heels for summer! The memory foam soul keeps my feet comfortable all day.
The shoes fit great and are very comfortable. Can't wait to wear them this summer!
Very comfortable, true to size and a nice light brown color. Well made and delivered very fast.
Love, love.  Have 2 pairs!
I love these shoes; the fit is perfect and I would have definitely bought other colors had they had my size.  Very good shoe.
I love the colour and style, however, my foot was going all the way through,<br />my toes were hanging off, I returned them :(
It was the right size but as you walk, toes begin to slide out the front. Not good.
Absolutely love them and very comfortable...I wear 7 or 7.5 and chose 7 based on description and they are perfect. They look good with everything from shorts to dresses. Everyone compliments them.<br /> Fast shipment too.
Super comfy
Very nice sandals.  Hope to purchase more in different colors!
Sooo comfortable and leather is really soft!
Love these shoes! I have a wide foot and found these shoes to be very comfortable! Better quality than expected!
Love these shoes!
Not as comfortable as my other skechers flip flops, but they are pretty and for awhile they are good.
Can't go wrong with Skechers!
MY MOM BOUGHT FOUR PAIRS TOTAL
Super comfy  don't know how durable they are
good
They are so comfortable and fit snug the strap isnt loose fitting.
Unfortunately the strap broke on them after my daughter wore them for about a week. She did love them up until then though.
These shoes are perfect to wear at work or just for running around doing errands. I love these shoes!
Love these! Super comfy, and really cute.
These are uncomfortable. The straps bite. Mine broke in the sole where the strap joins in, after the second wear. The sole is so soft that it cannot keep the straps embedded in. This is the first Skechers I was unhappy with. I have several other designs that I am happy with. Pass on this.
Fits ok, a little tight across top of foot.
These sandals are so cute and at first they were very comfortable, however, after walking in them for less than 30 minutes I ended up with blisters on the tops of my feet where the white fabric wears on your skin. Very rough and I see no way of correcting the problem. After 1 week, I still have scabs...<br /><br />Sketchers gets an F for this shoe.
for the price, it's ok. These are not the same style as last years model. The strap pinched the top part of my foot. Not that comfortable if walking long distance.
Love the Sandels. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.
Super soft with support
Previously ordered size 9 but too big so gave to a friend and ordered size 8. Fit comfortably and soles very cushiony but strap cut into the top of my feet after walking in them outside for 30 minutes on Tuesday - I have open cuts that bled and and have required bandages - it is Saturday and I still cannot wear any shoes with straps on the top of my feet so have resorted to sneakers for now. Not worth returning since I bought them cheaper on Amazon Prime Day but next time I will pay more attention to feedback I saw from another person about the tops cutting into the feet.
love these sandals.  Very comfortable.  package arrived on time as expected.  Thank you!
Heavier than I would like, otherwise comfortable.
A little on the small side, but actually comfortable for the height of he heel. Impressed with what sketchers did with the comfort.
Still love these shoes, though I wished I had gotten a half size larger.
The length is good but the strap is super tight
Bougt a size 7 as I always do with my skechers. These were right across the top. I'm hoping wearing them will break them in
Love these. Especially with jeans or a maxi dress. Comfy. These are my more dressy flops.
shoe runs small buy a size larger........but then the straps a slightly loose...get it right Sketchers and correct your sizing
I love these flip-flops, but a little disappointed...  one of the rhinestones fell off!  I would still buy another pair!
I love these flip flops! I had gotten a similar pair last year and was p**sed to find that they were out of stock everywhere, eBay and overstock.com too! But I'm so happy to have this pair and for $15 cheaper! And they're so comfy! My sister who is super picky even loves them! And that's saying something!
Very comfy, like walking on air. Like it so much that I'm thinking of getting another one in a different color.
While they were attractive and we'll made, they were way too big. I usually wear an 8 and I followed the suggestion and ordered up one size and got a 9.I should have ordered down one size to a 7.
I got the white pair from another on-line store but since I order many pairs of shoes from Amazon and depend on the reviews here, I thought I'd write my thoughts. The bottom of the shoe is soft and awesome. I love the yoga foam. The straps are stiff but they weren't too bad. I had to return them because the straps were too wide/loose, and I don't even have skinny feet. It was a lot of work just to keep them on my feet to walk. I was sad to return them because they are so cute! I have ordered the grey/black pair (same style) from Amazon. One of the reviews said that they were a little snug at first so maybe they will actually stay on my feet when I walk. I will update my review when I receive them.  Can't wait! Update 1: Ordered size 7 in grey/black braided strap. The strap was more snug and I think it would have worked but it was too short. My heel would hang off the back a little bit. So now I am returning the 7's and ordering the 8's. Update 2: Got size 8's yesterday. The straps are a little snug but do-able. They actually stay on my feet. The length is just right so I will keep this pair! Third time's a charm! 4/24/16-Update 3: The size 8 straps were too tight after all. Returned them. Ordered size 7 in black gem. They fit perfect so I kept them. I've had them for about 10 months and the strap is getting a little loose but I can still wear them to work just fine.
So comfy !!
The most comfortable pair of sandals ever !  The day they delvd, I wore them all day while out shopping...I recvd so many compliments !
I typically wear an 8N or sometimes a 7.5M, and I purchased a size 7, and it fits perfectly!
These are super cute on, but rub blisters awfully! The strap cut into my foot as I walked which crated the blisters. I can only wear these for a short time before blisters start forming again
These shoes are gorgeous! The only thing I found wrong was they run a little small. I wear a 7 1/2 - 8 normally. I ordered the 8's hoping that it would work, but they were still  a little too small. I will order the next size up and that should fix my issue! Otherwise, these shoes are great!
The shoes didn't last 2 months and the side strap pulled completely out of the sole. They have been worn maybe 25 times in the 52 days we have had them and maybe all day 5 times. My wife is  5'11&#34; a very fit person and under a 135 lbs you would think that a Skechers product would be fabricated to hold up longer than 52 days with very light use as their products are advertised as a excellent quality product. It is past the return period so she has a pair of useless non repairable flops these might be a poorly fabricated pair but not worth buying if no one will back the product for no more than 30 days I will post a picture when I can and you will be able to see the flops look brand new and not abused at all. Do yourself a favor buy from the store or zappos that will take a return of this nature.
Great shoes very comfortably thanks.
I like this.
Fit great and feels like a yoga mat
I live in these shoes! I find the support for my feet is fantastic; and I wear them to do yard work; to walk; to go out; and they are wonderful. I wear a 7 so ordered an 8 and it is perfectly comfortable; the yoga foam design contributes to its wear-ability all day.  A little extra length on the shoe; but I like my shoes a bit loose; not tight. So it is a perfect 8.
They are fabulous! Cute and comfortable
So comfy!  Love them!
Perfect fit!! They are so comfy and the elevation of the heel is great because the foot isn't slanted forward too much for any ankle strain. Gorgeous and would buy again.
Love them! Super comfy and cute enough for everything from shorts to casual dresses!
They are like pillows on my feet....LOVE them!
always like skechers.  I have small feet and they are light weight, but yet support.  These are a little more dressy for going out.
These shoes are really cute and pretty comfortable. They felt very tight at first so I wasn't thrilled, but since they are cloth I guess, they stretched out nicely and now they fit fine. The cloth is a little scratchy though, so I took off one star for that. Otherwise, a very cute and comfy shoe!
I loved it!
I love it!!!!
Love these !
Love them!
Very cute... love these!  They are comfortable enough to walk around in all day.  I bought the white and will probably order in another color.
This shoe would have been perfect had it not been for the front or top strap part.  The bottom part is so soft and feels wonderful. The top part is painful after a couple of hours. The cloth or material is rough and the edge is tough and rough and ended up cutting into my skin. So I have a red mark in the shape of the sandle strap and a healing scab marks. I  had another similar sketchers flip flop which I loved and wore almost daily that was similar to this but the top part was definitely made out of a soft cloth unlike this shoe. I will have to return the shoe.  So sad because it is such a pretty flip flop and I wanted it to be comfortable so bad. The picture I attached is four days healed
Beautiful sandals and very comfortable
I love it, it look great
Very comfortable! I own 3 other pairs in other colors ðŸ˜ƒ
The most comfortable shoes ever!!!<br />One major problem!  I want another pair<br />and they are always sold out!
I love the shoe. It is very comfortable for most of the day and stylish. But by the end of the day I find some spots on my foot a little sore.It might eventually stretch out to conform to my feet.  Biggest problem is if i'm walking on uneven ground, my foot twists to the floor almost knocking me of balance. Seems that the shoe doesn't have enough support to keep my feet from slipping to the side. So I wear it when walking on on solid ground.
nice she loves them
Love em!!!  Soooooo comfy.
Very comfortable! Straps are a bit snug.
My mother purchased a pair of sandals like these in a different color locally and loved them.  She has a lot of trouble with pain in her feet and generally has to switch off shoes at least daily, and often 2-3 times in a day, particularly if we are doing any walking.  She was able to wear these shoes all day and remarked that they were extremely comfortable.  She had me order this second pair in white to make sure she had comfortable pair of shoes for an upcoming cruise.
Very comfortable and stylish, can wear with capri pants, jeans, or dress.
Very classy and comfortable.  I have women stop and ask me where I got these.  They can't believe it when I tell them they are Sketchers.  I love them.
LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE.
I walked right out of them! very shallow heel
im a little worried they will stretch and be too big, but they are so very comfy!!
probably 1/2 to full size larger
Good fit and made well. Love the arch support..
Very comfortable easy to wear  I would buy again
Nice shoe.
The shoes are a big large and seem loose. With the strap on, it's hold my feet still manageable but the heel doesn't seem very balance
I love my Sketchers!
Price could be lower
just a tad too roomy but fabulous feel.  Lightweight Like walking on pillows.  Gives your leg a good look, you look taller and leaner and  because of the platform wedge design no back problems.  All in all Fantastic
These are very comfortable shoes.  I would give 5 stars if they came in half sizes.  I normally wear an 81/2 in sketchers.  After reading reviews I ordered an 8 because a 9 is generally too big for me.  The bed of the shoe fits well but the top of my foot is tall so the strap is quite tight and hurts by the end of the day (I work on my feet).  I was amazed at how much the rest of the shoe stretches to the shape of your foot. So, these are my short day/walk shoes.  I get constant compliments on how cute they are and have recommended them often:). Also, this shoe is very lightweight and the wedge is sturdy so I don't worry about rolling my ankles.
Really comfortable and half the price in the Skechers store!
Very comfortable but in the closed one I have to go down a size.
These shoes look good and are comfortable.
This shoes where for my daughter. She loves them, they are so comfortable :)
Extremely comfortable, well priced.  Will recommend to others
I love these shoes, they are great to wear at work and because I stand all day it helps that these shoes have memory foam padding for comfort.  They have some height to them so you don't feel so dowdy wearing the typical orthopedic shoes.  By no means are they close to the comfort of the orthopedic shoes but they are a great substitute and at the end of the day my feet feel a lot better than they did before I got these.  I still wear thin socks with them and from time to time I wash these in the washer and it has not damaged them.  I did notice they run a little on the larger side so I would order one size down if possible especially because they stretch.  There was no break-in period for these shoes with me, from day one they were so comfortable - I highly recommend them if you need work shoes and stand a lot at your job.
Great fit and actually stayed comfortable throughout the day! As a teacher, this is very important! I might buy other colors too ...
I love Skechers, this is the second pair I have, Parallel and Cali I LOVE THEM BOTH!  I also have several pairs of sneakers.
I love these shoes. I am a hairdresser with bone spurs. These are awesome.
I was so excited to get these for work- but when I  put them on, I could tell they were to 'loose'. Was hoping the reason they were made from the stretchy weave, was to fit nicely & comfortably. Though I wear a standard 7.5 US shoe, these were, but had about an inch of space in the toe area.<br />I had to send back, Had to ask for refund, as the 7 in this style/color was sold out.
Couldn't keep as the foot slips as you walk
Got as expected but had a strange odor. Almost fishy smell. I've tried everything and I can't get the smell out.
Love them, worth every penny
Thery are just fine. Thank you very much
This is the first pair of a Skecher shoe I am totally dissatisfied with!  Not Skechers comfort at all!  Memory foam does very little in cushioning.<br />My feet began to hurt after a couple of hours. My heels ached for a few days afterwards.  There's no support and no give to the sole so it's like walking on bricks....completely dissatisfied with this shoe and disappointed with Skecher!  If I could I'd rate a ZERO
Have edema, haven't worn a higher heel in ages. Swelling went down , am one happy camper. Doesn't feel like a wedge, almost like being on flats again. Love, Love, Love
Love these shoes!!!!!
Love my shoes!!!!!...
Left both slipped in back when walking
They are a little big but they are very comfortable & really good looking with the silver weave.
The heel of these shoes seems very narrow and unsupportive.  There is absolutely no tread very slippery and not appropriate for the work I had in mind.  They are kind of cute and definitely comfy
they slide of when I walk
perfect shoe for outings.  I just wish I could get in other less glittery colors!
Great shoes! I work on my feet for 9 hours and these are great right out of the box. I highly recommend.
Very nice
Love these!
love these shoes...I can walk forever in them
Love them but not an all day wear for me
it is very good and i like it
Love theses shoes! I should have ordered a half size smaller, but it still is not a bad fit. So if you order theses you can easily go a 1/2 size smaller! I have received many compliments on theses too! I love Skechers!!!!
Love the shoes very light and comfortable
Very comfortable from top to bottom!
shoes fit very good you can wear them all day your feet don't get tired
I think these were factory rejects.  The right shoe is way bigger than the left shoe.
Really comfortable and great for work
The shoe fits comfortably and is very stylish.
Love these, so comfortable, but suggest a half size down as they are not a snug fit. Will be ordering a smaller size.
I absolutely loved these shoes! I was one my feet for about 8 hours. Yes! I only sat down for lunch. I even took notes standing up. I put that they didn't have a good arch support because I really feel that they don't. I have flat wide feet and if something usually has &#34;good arch support,&#34; it is bothersome to me, and not comfortable. I was looking at Bernie Mev's and I just couldn't get past the price, so I found these and they are so worth the money!
Great shoe. Comfortable.
I purchased a size 6.5 and a 7, as I din't know how they would fit. The size 6.5 was just fine
Happy
My only difficulty with these is my long toes, often a problem though with shoes.  That aside, the shoe is extremely comfortable and will accommodate an orthopedic insert.  These are a perfect summer dress shoe for anyone who often can't wear heels.
They are a little narrow and after a while my foot feels like it is squeezed too much and I need to take them off.
Skechers are great for wide flat feet, but these were too big even for me. Returned for a size smaller (too bad 1/2 sizes aren't available), and I hope that one fits. Otherwise, the style, comfortable footbed, and height of these were perfect.
Love them, very comfortable and light weight
I would've given 5 stars, good pricing, cute style, and comfort. However I had to exchange for half size down and that doesn't happen to me very often. I normally wear 6.5 or 7. I ordered a 6.5 but they were a little too long, my heels came out of the shoes when I walked. Thank you Amazon for the great customer service the new pair came in no time. So the size 6 fit me perfectly.<br />I recommend order a half size down. These shoes are very cute and very comfortable to walk on all day, I wear them for work and I know my feet are thanking me.
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes!
I went up half a size because I have a high arch and was worried the strap across the top would be too tight across the top of my foot. I'm glad I did. This is my first shoe with a large wedge but they are comfortable and don't feel as high as they are.
The only problem I have with them is that they fit large I wear a size 8 so I bought a size 8 but I could have bought a 7 or 7.5 other than that they are really great!!!
Good buy
I love these shoes and I plan to buy a spare since I can see myself wearing these until they are worn out!
Very cute and very comfortable. I replied no to good arch support but that is for me personally. I have very high arches and rarely does any show provide good support for me. I'm sure it is good support for the average person. For others with high arches, the strap across the top is comfortable. The price was great too!!
I have a high arch so the cross strap is a little to tight sometimes, but overall love the way these shoes feel, like a glove
The only thing is I throught the heel would be soft rubber and a little more bounce.
So comfortable,I'm a hairdresser and stand all day,that's what I wear.
Sent them back because they were uncomfortable on my toes.
Very comfortable.
Fashionable and comfortable shoes.  I am having a hard time finding comfortable shoes.  I have ordered two more pairs of these shoes in case<br />this shoe model is discontinued.
These are wonderful shoes.  stretchy and very comfortable.  I've been on my feet most all day now and they still feel good.  No blisters.  Good side support.  Love them! Cute and lots of compliments.
I normally were a size 8 1/2 to size 9 so I ordered a size 8 1/2 and they are much to big my heal pops out the back. As for the product, they are super cute and I can't wait for my size 8 to arrive.
They are comfortable, and nice. Love Skechers!!
These shoes are comfortable, cute, sturdy, and I get compliments every time I wear them.  Super versatile style!
I love these shoes. I'm committed to memory foam. It's the only way I can walk without hurting. I have metatarsal pain that can't be helped. Memory foam and Sketchers are a God send. Now shoes for a dressy look with skirts and dresses. Never thought I'd see that in a brand known for athletic shoes. Thank you Sketchers
I am an Esthetician who eorks on her feet most of the day and these are doing what I wanted by keeping me comfortable most of the day. By the end of the day they are a little grabby in the toe area but I think all and all they are a good shoe so I bought two.
I liked that this sandal had a heel that gives it a dresser feel.  Could wear this shoe all day. Very comfortable.  My daughter also bought a pair and wears them to the office.  Good for casual Friday
Finally!  After returning the first pair of Skechers Cali Parallel Wedge Sandals the second pair did the trick.  Very cute,  comfortable shoes though the heels were a bit loose to begin with.  After wearing them for a day the fit is better.  The memory foam seems to be doing its thing.  Second day at work wearing them and getting all kind of compliments!
They are nice. I ordered the right size but the back of my heel slides out and the top strap across your foot is super tight and leaves bad marks, cuts off circulation.  The elastic seems to be off.  I have to give them a good pull after an hour or so, slip on and off to get comfortable again. I didn't return them because I thought I could break them in and the top would stretch but it never did.
Very stylish and comfortable as well, esp. with the open toe for summer.  I did notice that the notch for the Vee for the open toe covers more on one foot than it does on the other, something only I would notice unless someone is staring intently at my feet!  I bought 2 pairs in different colors, one in a size 7, which fits me like a glove and I can feel the arch, and the other in 7 1/2, slightly looser, the arch is slightly off but I like having more room for my toes.  I have had many surgeries for &#34;hammer toes&#34; the last 2 years, the result of wearing high heels all my working life!  Now Skechers are the only shoe I will wear almost.  The copycats like Madden cannot compare for fit and comfort.  Although this particular model is not my favorite pair, it is one of my top choices for the summer months.  It looks pretty enough to be dressy but always great with whatever u have on. I like it better than my GoWalk3's but, then again, totally different shoe style and different purpose.  I would recommend this style for a few hours of casual shopping, walking on smooth paths, parties or hanging out; not for all day work shoes where u have to be on your feet all day or any strenuous walking.  Just a great, all-around, comfy and pretty shoe.  I do like the natural color with the golden threads better, it goes with everything and is just more attractive. The other color I bought is the black multi with the silver threads, which is very vibrant in color and kind of clashes if you are wearing another plaid or multi-colored skort or short, so it is not as versatile as I thought, color-wise.  I take good care of my shoes and tend to wear them for years; some of my Skechers are 10 years old and still feel good, but the innovations they have made make these new styles so lightweight and comfortable, yet supportive, I'm ready to ditch my old ones now and keep these for the next 10 years.  If I outlive my shoes, that is!
It's comfortable to walk tho it gets my feet wet coz of the foam. A bit big. I should have got the 7 instead. But I'm happy anyway.ðŸ˜€
it's very snug.so im trying to stretch it.im size 7.the length is perfect but im wide so my blood on my toes will not circulate.it looks nice though and im sure i can walk miles in it if after stretching the toe part.
High back hurts Achilles
Love this product as they have memory foam cushioning, and I can finally wear heels that make me look taller and thinner in comfort.  A miracle!
The best way for me to describe these shoes is they are very comfortable in ways most shoes aren't.  And yet also UNcomfortable in ways most shoes aren't.  The memory foam insole is really soft, and you hardly notice you are wearing a wedge with height.  The shoe itself stretches to &#34;hug&#34; your foot... Which is where it is a little strange.  The shoe is made of a bunch of elastic bands in a &#34;basket weave&#34; to form the shoe.  (Think of an old potholder you might have made when you were young)  The stretchy elastic is rough... Generally, elastic directly on skin is usually very uncomfortable!<br /><br />Most reviewers said it runs big.  I am normally a 6.5, so I ordered a size 6.  It feels a bit too small - with the elastic bands squeezing at my feet.  But I can see how a 6.5 might be too big, and how the elastic bands would stretch out too much. The shoe needs the tight tension to keep your toes from slipping out the peep toe in front, and to keep your heel from slipping out the back.  At the same time - being a bit small - my toes start to hurt from being pushed against the peep toe.<br /><br />The elastic makes this shoe very unique.  I think it looks much better on your feet than in the picture.  Overall, it is very comfortable and it doesn't make your feet hurt from standing and walking in them.  It just makes your feet feel like they are wrapped in bound in elastic!
They squeeze a little tight because of the woven top, but it isn't uncomfortable.  They're the quality and fit I've come to expect from Sketchers brand.
My wife loves these! I have to admit I wasn't too sure what I thought from the photo but they look really good. The fit is perfect and very comfortable. This is a sandal she would definitely purchase again! As usual fast shipping.
Its comefortabl , since I don't like flat shoes the high of this sandel is good but the elastic is tight a little because the size is 6.5
These shoes are So comfortable, just like all the other Sketchers I have!
Great shoes.......I wore them to the Colorado Renaissance Festival and they were really comfortable<br /><br />f
These shoes are very comfortable. I have a hard time with shoes and sandles because I have a narrow foot. These shoes fit great.
I bought a pair of open toe for me and my mom. We both loved them but mine fit me a half size to big, her's fit perfect so she asked me to order her another pair but closed toe for the colder weather.  Suprizingly the closed toe ones fit her a size too big or I have to remember order them a half size smaller.
The left shoe was snugger and the glitter thread in the shoe rubbed on my left foot. Had to return.
Love these shoes!  I have them in 3 different styles.  Very comfortable.
The size eight that I had bought for my mom, fit her to big. The size size that I bought for myself, also fit me to big.  I am a little upset because I had tried them on in the store and they seem to fit fine. I am going to return the items in the meantime and see if I can get them in the right size.
They are so comfortable. I have flat feet and the gel is great on my feet.
I really like these so far. They do run a bit big, but fit me fine. I normally wear an 11.5, but on advice from other reviewers, I ordered the 11 (althought I sincerely doubt an 11.5 would have been an option). I have heel spurs and issues with Plantar fasciitis because, as anyone can imagine, it's very hard to find cute shoes in my size that have any kind of support. I end up with a lot of Target flats, which just aren't great for your feet when you're on your feet all day. These are extremely comfortable. I wish they were a little cuter or that there were a few more color options considering they aren't inexpensive, but I'm glad I purchased them. Will be looking for more Sketchers now.
I love my shoes, I have planter fasciitis and I'm able to wear these shoes at least 8 hours before complaining
The elastic strap is quite tight but gets moderately better with wear. It works for me, but I can quite easily see why it could be too tight for some feet.
I bought these shoes in 8m in solid black after trying on this style in the Skechers store and falling in love. However, they were too expensive to justify. When I found them on Amazon for $20 cheaper, I was ecstatic and ordered them immediately. MISTAKE. First of all, they came later than expected,  but the real problem is that they do NOT fit. Upon trying on the right shoe, I was thrilled. Cute, comfortable, and a snug foot. The problem is with the left shoe, which is at least two or three times looser than the other shoe and actually slips off the back of my heel when I walk in them. There was such a difference I thought maybe they were different sizes - nope, both eights. This is not a case of my feet being two different sizes; I am fortunate to be a perfect 8 in both feet, and whatever size difference there may be is entirely negligible.<br /><br />tl;dr: if you have two very different sized feet, these are the shoes for you!!!!
I love these Sketchers brand of shoes - but the sizes are very inconsistent. I got these in the silver color - bought the same size in black from Amazon - they're like a 1/2 size too small.
Have purchased quite a few pairs of Skechers, in fact many pairs. Find comfort and be comfortable.
beautiful but too narrow in 8or 8 1/2<br />couldn't keep  too uncomfortable
Cute and clever. Very comfortable yet fun sandals! My foot is a little wide and they fit great. The wedge heel is perfect, provides a little height but still allows me to walk in them all day.
Very comfortable shoes. I ordered half-size bigger based on other reviews and it fits perfectly. Feel cramps in the toes by the end of the day which was expected.
It can get tight at times but it's still the most  comfy my feet have been. You can't even feel the height and the memory foam is great
Great looking shoe. Very comfortable. Should have ordered 1/2 size down.
So Narrow and tight that I had to return them.
Extremely comfortable!!
It's very comfortable. Feels like wearing a Skechers athletic shoe and yet it goes well with office attire.
Very comfortable shoes!
I told my friends to buy them very comfortable wear them all day look nice on your feet
Im a true size 8 but 8.5 fits way better, my toes are not hanging out. It is very comfy and love the style and look on my feet. I wish I can give it a 5 stars but I can't simply because of the color. I ordered Taupe/silver but when I received it the taupe is more like deep gray not even close to the color on the pic. But other than that still great shoes...I'm planning to buy it in tan/silver color.
Wore them all evening and they were very comfortable.  Nice looking on foot.
Ordered a half size bigger, and they are perfect.  I'm 7 months preggers and most of my shoes are cutting into my feet, or not supportive enough. I'm wearing these (3 colors) and sneakers exclusively now. They are so solidly on my feet, and cushy, that I can run in them (well...that run-walk thing you have to do when you're halfway across the street and the signal changes.)
Pretty, but roo large in the heel.
Best shows ever! My feet no longer hurt at the end of the day!
Like walking on a cloud! I received them on time and really love these shoes. I normally use size 7.5, but Skechers tends to be on the smaller side so I ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly. Great shoes!
So comfy, somewhat dressier, can even dance in them! They don't hurt my bunions and heel spurs!
Shoe is very comfortable, but due to the material of the shoe, they really make my feet sweat.
Very comfortable and nice color!
Very comfortable!
this shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have worn.  Everyone loves it and it goes with many many outfits.
II bought htese shoes for trip to France. I have worn them a couple of times around town and they are very comfortable. The test will be walking around Paris but they are very lightweight, for weight in the suitcase, and very stylish. I really like to Go Walk shoes from Sketchers so I think these will also be great.
there nice in short stints ,,don't by them for just walking ,,more fashion than anything
I love the idea of the shoes, but not the strap that goes across the top of your foot.  It is super tight compared to the rest of the shoe and causes my foot to go a bit numb when I wear them for longer periods of time.  My feet are not oversized, and I don't need a wider size.  I am on my feet all day teaching, and the shoe itself if comfortable, just not the strap that goes across the top.  I am really sad about this because I love the look of them.  I would have sent them back, but they didn't come directly from Amazon and I had to pay shipping as it was because they weren't included in Prime, so I didn't want to have to pay again to send them back. :(
These shoes are so comfortable that I can't even put it into words.
Liked the shoe.  Not sure how to describe fit.
I love skechers shoes.  They are comfortable and the best shoes ever.
Love them!
I desperately wanted to love these sandals. They are totally my style. I love the Bernie Mev/Bernie Mev type woven shoes. I love Skechers. On these, however, the strap cuts off ALL circulation on the top of my foot! I have high arches; so high, ballet dancers used to envy them. I never thought the strap would be woven so tightly; it's like a tourniquet! Today is the third time I've worn these (with plenty of days off in between). I thought they might stretch and give a little, but they have not. A few minutes ago I finally gave up and just tucked the strap on the inside; it's the only way I can make it through the rest of the day. I'm at work and barefoot is not an option. These will either be going to the Salvation Army or I will wear them as I'm wearing them right now - Grandma Grunt style with the strap tucked in. I'm extremely disappointed.  Maybe if you have a normal or just a moderately high arch, these will work for you. But for me, they're KILLERS. :(
I love these shoes, stylish and comfortable!
I love this shoes style and they are very comfortable, however they runs kind of narrow, I need wider shoes.
awesome , would like to have a pair in every color!  I have two prs now.
Comfortable
Love the shoes<br />One was bigger than the other?<br /> Can't believe I had to pay postage to send back a defective product
For some reason, this pair of sketchers is smaller than the other pairs I have bought. They are not as comfortable but still cute. I can only wear them
Love these shoes, they are perfect for work. My only complaint is that, since I have a very high instep & arch, after 3/4 of my day, the strap across the top of the foot feels tight, and I need to take them off for a little while before resuming wear.
I have quite a wide foot and it was suggested that I should go up one size. I usually wear a 91/2, so I ordered a 10. These shoes are SO cute so I gave them 5 stars. They fit fine lengthwise, but are snug across the wide part of my foot. I wore them for about 15 minutes and could feel some discomfort.  I hope with wear, they will stretch out into a more relaxed fit. If not, I will try taking them to my shoe guy who has a shoe stretcher.
I have this in black and will probably get every color available.  Very comfortable!
Love these shoes! They are the same as the Bernie Mev shoes but about 30% less expensive.  I wore them for 8 hours straight at a museum and was comfortable. I received many compliments on the shoes.
These shoes look really cute on, and are super comfy and light, but the nylon covered gel-pack material used for the inner sole turns my feet into a hot mess.
Very comfortable
First time purchasing shoes from Amazon.  I am pleased to say that these shoes are &#34;SURPURB&#34; they are extremely comfy and stylish.  I wish sketchers come out with a denim color and other multi colors compared to what they offer thus far.<br /><br />Shoe fit true size and is very comfortable
Love the shoes they fit perfect
great shoes! just needed to order a different size, my bad!
I really like these to wear with pants.  I prefer the strappy ones to go with capris, etc.<br />I have four pair now, multi, white and black in the strappy kind and these with the heal.  Love the stretch weave and fit.  Memory foam bottoms are great.  Looking now for a pair in gray
very comfortable
Love them!  Very comfortable. Lots o. f compliments.
These are the most comfortable shoes and look really nice. I am enjoying them a lot.
These shoes were a little smaller than I expected but still fit. NIce look to them.
Love Love Love these!!! They are lightweight, so comfortable, Im a hairstylist, i stand all day, I'm about to get another pair. The stretchy weaved material is so comfortable, stretches but not weak at all..room for wear and tear. Everyone asks about these shoes when I wear them, constantly ;)
I usually wear a size 6 but in order for them to be wide enough due to the style I had to get a half size bigger.  One of my toes took a few wearings to get toughened up with the material over it but now they are very comfy.  They are also very light weight and good to walk all day in.  I just wish the other styles didn't have that weird reflective material on them or I would have bought more colors.  Could also skip having the name on the back of the shoe too.  They are running out of these so better get it fast if they have your size.  I went to store to try on first, that is how I knew the run small a bit.
I love these shoes. All-day comfort
Very comfortable fit.
Love them.  Very comfortable.
I have wide feet, so I order half a size up. These stretchy shoes are roomy enough to accommodate my duck feet and they look good, they really do! Comfy and the right height; just enough coverage to be cool, yet supportive.
I have granny feet just like my mom and grandmother so I'm unable to wear just any shoe. My feet hurt allot so I have to have shoes that offer cushioning and comfort. These shoes are so amazing that I can wear them all day without my feet hurting when I get home from work. Thank you to those that wrote honest reviews as that's what swayed me to buy these even though I was skeptical. The gel cushion in the shoes and the soft materials used make an amazing difference in getting me through my work day. I will be buying more of these! :)
They hurt your toes!
They really are very comfy but they fit big am a size 8 and I think I could do a size 7  7.5 for sure I have had to put a insole in, so to be honest it is alittle hard to judge what size to order
I have problems with my legs,pain, these shoes help my leg pain a lot, I ordered another pair! But they both have lost their shape! Elasticity stretched!
the toe area has little to no stretch and my toes go numb. Hoping they stretch out.
Very cute!  Fits true to size.
Love these shoes so cute and comfortable I also have them in black.  I want every color!
Too narrow in the toe, squished them & one of the holes to the peep toe was WAYYY smaller then the other. Pretty sure they were defective. I got them very marked down & I think that was why ;-( darn.
I am always little skeptical when ordering shoes on the internet but knowing I can send them back is encouraging.  I took a chance on these Sketchers as I have good experience with this brand.  They have really come a long way.  I have ordered my size 9 and can say they are true to size.  They fit me like a glove.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  My feet are not exactly skinny but I don't suffer from swollen feet either so the shoe feels comfortable the whole day.  I love the Sketchers soles as it gives you a nice height yet your feet don't suffer like they do with high heels.  They look very nice too.
NOT SO CUTE  SENT THEM BACK
Super cute sandals that feel like a walking shoe.  I bought a 1/2 size smaller & they fit perfectly.
Beware...although I LOVE Skechers Go Walks (Marshallows on your feet and I own 3 pair) these were not comfortable.  I tried them on and walked around the store with them for 20 minutes shopping, which is my way to test shoes.  By 15 minutes my toes were screaming, as were being pinched together.  As you can see from the peek a boo toe, the shoe top is a stretchy weave and really binds your toes into a little hole.  I wear an 8 medium and couldn't wait to get these off my feet.  Try Go Walks.
I purchased this shoe in black from a local store loved them. The pair I received from Amazon the left shoe was so tight I thought they would stretch out a little bit, they do not. I should have returned them immediately, my error. I can not wear them unfortunately. When they are made correctly super comfortably !
So incredibly comfortable! Fit perfectly. Walked all over streets of Spain for 10 days. Amazing shoes, especially for the price! Other makers sell the same shoe for twice the price, but these are just as good (and maybe better)! Don't doubt this purchase - they are excellent!
I was very disappointed in this shoe. I love sketchers and thought to myself finally a cute wedge heel. These have got to be the ugliest shoes in person I believe I have ever seen.  They look cheap with the soles and rubber wedge, the fabric was discolored where it met the wedge. These shoes look very cheap. I was super disappointed and returned them right away.
LOVE LOVE!! This sandal is awesome! I have bad back and this shoe gives me a slight heel  without the pain. hubby said they were sexy w my white jeans! nice n bouncy ...wish they had in every color ..id buy them all!
Love them
It does have a very comfy shoe bed and I like the support the stretchy woven factor lends. That is important to me because of previous foot surgeries and the difficulty of finding comfortable shoes. As yet, I have not worn them for an extended period of time so I don't feel qualified to render an opinion as to how long they can comfortably be worn in the course of a day. I love the multi-color as it will go with just about every color in spring/summer wardrobe. I could easily buy this in another color also.
If I bought them again, I would get a half size smaller as I have a narrow foot and they seem to run a little big.
I love the shoes, very comfortable, the only thing I did not like was the pressure on my toe, it caused some discomfort by the end of the day, but that is the only problem I have with them
I would recommend buying from this seller, and these shoes to all my friends and family.
The skechers are wonderful shoes to wear for support.  These shoes are also fashionable, and can be worn with a variety of different outfits.  I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.
Love my new Sketchers. Have a foot problem and the memory foam is the only thing I've found in a shoe to make walking painless. That was my 15th pair. Love them all and can't thank them enough for coming out with dressy shoes. Never thought I'd see that, EVER. Now I can wear them with skirts and dresses. You go Sketchers. Bring Em on!!
Since I was born with crooked feet (my bones don't line up like most people's) I have an extremely hard time finding shoes that fit, don't hurt my feet, and most of all look OK. These are the most comfortable &#34;cute&#34; shoes I've ever owned. I tried on a pair at a shoe store and then bought three more pairs in different colors from Amazon! They have cushiony memory foam and a stretchy top, which gives and conforms to my feet. I highly recommend these sandals for anyone struggling with foot problems.
very nice shoe....needed it a little wider though....guess I should have tried to find it in wide
Love them!!!!
I love them!! I purchased them in 4 colors. They are extremely comfortable & can be casual or a bit dressier.The fit is to your normal size.
These shoes are attractive and what I was looking for but are way too narrow and tight. The Bernie Mev look-alike version is perfect.
Love the color mix but do not fit as well as similar shoes.  The backstrap does not fit properly--loose which makes it tricky to walk in the shoes more than an hour.
Good looking shoes....they feel right and are very comfortable.
These shoes are amazing  and so comfortable  , I REALLY  feel like walking on clouds , but it is a little bit tight , so I hope they will stretch ASAP :)
so cute, but the elastic at the front cut into my toes--that really hurt.  the left shoe slipped at the heel.  there is no way to adjust this. since the shoes were so uncomfortable,  I had to send them back.  I was very disappointed..
Most amazingly comfortable shoe! Just wish Id gone up a half size. Regretting not heeding the warnings about this from other review.  I wear an 8, should have gone w/ 8.5 as the strap across the arch & toes are tight & after wearing them for a few hours my toes fall asleep. Dummy me was so excited to wear them I threw away the box and my reciept before I spent a day in them :(
Very fashionable and sooo comfortable!!!!!
I've yet to to be dissapointed in any Sketchers purchase. I am a huge fan of the brand and these are super cute.
They run a little long in the length but the elastic that goes across the top of my foot seems to squeeze a bit too tightly after wearing them for a few hours.  They're just ok comfort-wise.
wonderful shoes!!
I wish they fit!  Very nice looking and comfortable. Footbed is cushy and the woven top held well in front.  Heel just never stayed put for me.
Cute and comfy shoe/sandal ... provided you have &#34;correct&#34; foot.<br /><br />1) HEEL. The heel is not very secure or stable. I have a heel that is a bit on the narrow side, and the shoe slips from my heel when I walk. If you have narrow -- or even a medium -- heel, this might not be the shoe for you.<br /><br />2) LENGTH. I am a true 8 and have many Skechers in 8. This shoe fits me well, particularly at the ball of the foot. However, the toe area is pointed and extra long. So, the shoe/sandal feels long on my foot, although the size & fit are correct.<br /><br />3) TOE BOX. The toe box is elongated and pointed. If you have extra long toes and a long middle toe, these might work well for you. For me, not so much. I look down and see looks of shoe with no toes in the extended toe box. I'm better off in the Skecher sandals with a rounded toe box ... and btw, I own well over 5 pairs of them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice shoe/sandal which is stable and comfortable. However, it does not fit like a typical Skechers shoe.
A little tight. Hope it will stretch some. Love the style!
Love these shoes! I bought two pair, two styles. I haven't been disappointed with either pair.
Very comfortable and stylish ,you wear it with pants jeans skirt and dress ,black shoes almost match any color of  the outfit.
It arrived just in time for my birthday & I put them on for the next 2 days straight.  One of the strap were longish to make room for those with wide feet...It's not a problem to me as I can always straighten them & hide.  Its super comfy & pretty.  My mum saw it & have asked me to order a pair for her.  Love it.  thanks Skecher
Amazing shoe - fits great and feels like walking in socks.
I usually take an 8.5 W and ordered an 8 and 9 in this shoe. The 8 fits perfectly and the stretchy fabric accommodates my wide foot with no issues. They were comfortable right out of the box. Ordering two more pairs in different colors and a pair for my daughter. Versatile - can wear dressy or casual - dresses or jeans.
I usually love Sketchers.  However, these run small and the straps leave an indentation on my feet and cut off the circulation.  Sketchers are usually SUPER comfortable, but these are NOT.  So bummed because now I have to waste my money shipping them back.
Comfortable and dressy
good, small my size
Received today. The shoes are used-not new. I can see that the sole has been worn they are dirty inside and were not in their original box.Returned.
OMG!  These are my dream-come-true work shoes! I am a blackjack dealer, on my feet for 8 hours, I usually go home and soak my feet!  The first night I wore these shoes ...they made me feel like dancing!  I just hope they wiil last as long as my other Skechers.
My go to pair of shoes. So so comfortable and fit perfectly. Cushiony and conform well to foot. I would definitely buy these again...and again and again!!
I had to work the leather on one of the shoes near my toe area to soften it some.  Otherwise, they are perfect!
Since my old ones gave up the ghost I've been looking for something to replace them.  Glad I found these!
nice looking shoe and has black/ brown leather so I can wear with alot of my clothes.
These are gorgeous shoes but I had to send them back because they were a half-size too large & would have been uncomfortable to walk in. Otherwise, like I said, Gorgeous shoes...reliable company. JJ
I  had to buy inserts.  Then the shoe fit comfortably.
These shoes are super cute and pretty comfortable - they are cushioned but lack arch support.  I usually don't think about arch support, but I can feel it in these if I'm walking around a lot.  Nothing a little insert doesn't fix, though!  They are a bit roomy for the size, but not a problem.  I'm quite pleased with them.
Love then!
GOOD
The buckle on top gave me blisters.
This is a great sandal. I was looking for one with memory foam for a long time, and they were exactly as I expected Skechers shoes to be. But the third time I put them on, the sole of the sandal started pealing off. I expected better quality from them.
I love these sandals! They fit perfectly and they are so comfortable!
love them
Should have sent them back but didn't keep the packaging. Tried to give them away and nobody wanted them so off to Goodwill they went. They're clunky and not very attractive.
Run large
Goog
THEY HAVE A HARD PLASTIC PIECE ON THE TOP, THAT TENDS TO HURT MY FOOT. RATHER DISAPPOINTED.
I have only worn them a couple times. I like them, but have to break them in. The part where the metal is rubs on my foot so I have to loosen the straps. I know they will be all right after I wear them a couple more times. I love skecher shoes.
Cute sandal and super cushioned. They are not perfect for me as I need a good arch support due to plantar fasciitis. So they don't have the support like the Women's Sketchers Reggae Rasta sandals. If I didn't have such screwed up feet, they would be great.
returned
Very comfortable. When ordering Skechers shoes, I usually have to order 1/2 to 1 size bigger but not true for this sandal.  I ordered my usual size and it fits well.
Yes. So comfy!  Beware the trick lighting though. The green is just green, there aren't any light flecks in the straps, as the pic implies. But super comfy!
Very nice shoe...good  for a narrow foot as they are adjustable..I wear and ordered an 9...Perfect fit. The only issue I have are a couple of spots that the shoe wears on and hurts....the little buckle over the toe kind of rubs that spot....so I may have to wear them in with socks. The soles are VERY comfortable.they hug and fit your foot well. They are a great walking shoe.I love the olive color.
Great fit & LOVE the price!
Exactly what I wanted.  I'm very pleased.
Very happy with these sandals. I bought a size larger
Nice basic off white for Spring and Summer.  Straps enable it to stay on your feet, so you don't trip, as you might with flip flops.
I ordered my regular size 10 and they were at least a size too long.  Returned them.
Very comfortable!  Love them!
These brown sandles are great. The color perfectly matches a vintage coach bag I have, so I usually wear them together. Mostly comfortable as well.
Great item. Good color. Comfortable fit for medium foot. If you swell, not so much
I have lots of arthritis in my feet and find it difficult to find shoes good for me.
Hurt my feet. No cushion,scratched top of feet where straps go across top of feet. Worst sketchers I've ever purchased. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone period. Wore them inside for a few minutes. COULDNT WAIT TO GET THEM OFF MY FEET THEY HURT SO BADLY & SCRATCHED FEET. Don't waste your money or time having to return them.
Comfortable and they kida go unnoticed.
They are very comfortable. Only thing I had to order a size up because they don't offer half sizes. What's up with that?
Awesome.
They are wonderful for my feet, I have high-arches and make my feet feel good.
Very comfy. I ordered an 8 which is my normal size and these are a bit too long. A 7 1/2 would have been better.
Grate
The cushion molds to my feet......like the thick wide rubber under the heel and toes. Comfortable summer shoe. Thank you...
Wasn't thrilled with these. They seemed comfortable enough, but the fact they were a little big led me to believe I might experience strap rubbing.  Interior sole cushion was very nice though.
Excellent and comfortable!
I ordered a number more confused , and I left it big . But they are equal to the publication and are very good .
The strap across the ankle is too short.  If you have flat feet, I suspect they would be fine.  And skinny ankles!  With high arches, the strap is painful.  The foot bed is very comfortable.  Beware! If you have to return them, you are charged shipping.  Very disappointing buying experience.
haven't wore them much yet
At the top of the shoe, where the toes reside, the shoe was too tight. The other parts of the shoe were otherwise comfortable, and the cushion as well.
Not enuf Velcro room to fit the width across the foot.  Also the triangle buckle was an irritant. I like the shoe but I will have to have a wide width from now on.
FAST delivery and SANDALS Comfortable!
The straps are all wrong for a person with a high arch. I love Skechers but these sandals had to go back because while the foodbed<br />is comfortable the straps rub all the wrong places.  I am still looking for a comfortable black sandal for cavus feet.
Cute sandals, a little scratchy but I'm sure the strap will soften with wear.  Some arch support due to the pillow tops.
comfortable can wear all day Love them
Very comfortable and attractive.  I thought I had ordered the pink but guess I pushed the wrong button and received the beige.  Color isn't as nice but decided to keep them.  Would much rather have perferred the pink
the plastic piece that connects the straps of shoes, cause scratches on the feet, very comfortable except the above
The only thing I can find wrong with them is the attachment at the top of arch doesn't have the Velcro  over the arch far enough and if someone had a high arch it could not be long enough to attach properly.
I now own three pairs.  When all other shoes are , which are few, hurt my arthritis in my large toe bone, then these are so far the only ones I can put on and look nice with them o
My daughter loves them. Mission accomplished.
The shoes are very nice, but for my feet, the strap closest to your toes is too short. One has to have a very skinny instep for the strap to close as it should. I barely had enough Velcro left to close it.
buen producto
The straps are very ridged and uncomfortable.  Not the quality expected from Skechers.  The front strap is narrow and high making it even more uncomfortable.
great. I have fat feet, but they are adjustable. comfortable too.
Very comfortable shoe! I bought this pair for my friend! She loves them! Wore them all day the first day she got them.
Great sandal for the summer.
I have a size 11 foot and most size 11's fit me.  However, I couldn't even get my foot in these sandals.  They run at least 1/2 to a full size small and narrow.  Maybe not narrow if you have a size 10 foot and try these size 11 sandals. I returned them.
I bought these as a gift for my wife, and they were better than expected. Great fit, and she really likes them. I think she was surprised. You see a lot of sandals that are nice, but they are 150.00  Nice pair of sandals for the price. Great look, and great fit.
Not happy at all with sizing, etc.  Returned them.  Plastic piece on top is uncomfortable and rubs.
Love them.
Great product
originally I loved these shoes but the strap already broke. It appears the strap rubbing on the stones wore it away. It has been less than 3 months. I tried to exchange them but it was past the return date. Very sad.
Love these shoes
Super-duper comfortable! Also, the glitzy straps are comfortable (have had other brands where  rhinestones dug painfully into the skin). Have  or needs for travel and they are very comfortable and holding up well !  Fit is true to size
Very nice & fits perfectly! Highly recommend to family & friends.
these are OK.
Just a bit short in the length, but I like the style.
Comodas
These looked cute but the space from sole to top is high meaning if you have a thick foot and high arch it would fit better. My feet are rather narrow and I don't have a high arch so the flip flops slide around....not good for a wedge with lift unless you want a twisted ankle.
Excellent pair! Comfortable and pretty. I spent my whole month long vacation walking around in these. Shopping and in the house. 10 stars!
Too bad they did not come in 1/2 sizes.  Therefore 4 stars.
Love these!  Comfort and class!!
As always Skechers never disappoints! This sandals are so comfortable. Fits as expected and delivery came quick! thumbs up.<br />I just Love Skechers..
I wasn't looking for arch support when I was buying these Adorable flip-flops.  The foot-bed is very comfortable, but the part that goes across the instep are hard and cause discomfort from time to time due to the rhinestones.  That is the part that keeps them from being &#34;wear all day&#34; shoes.  I have other flip-flops by Sketchers that are much more comfortable, so maybe less 'bling' is better.
love these go great with that cute little sundress,adds a little sparkle,yet the comfort of a athletic sandal,,,,very very cute
I am going to kill myself in these shoes.  Somehow 3 times the bottom fell out from under me and my big toe was caught in the shoe.  VERY DANGEROUS SHOES TO WEAR.
LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes!  I was looking for a casual sandal that could be a bit dressy if needed and this is definitely it.  I get compliments on them all the time.  The wedge makes them super comfy to walk around in all day and not get tired.
She loves them and has other pairs different colors
Wish Skechers will continue these lines of sandals.  So comfortable and so hard to find now.  Especially size 5.  I wear them all year round and I live in Vancouver.
Great shoe
Very cute, very comfortable. Skechers quality consistently good.
need smaller size, which they do not come in
I love these. Skechers sandals have never done me wrong! ...and they look great.
I really like these sandals!
Comfort and style
Cute for the price. comfy. I would get them in other colors.
Great love them so comfie
They are exactly what I was looking for, I'll put these on after our wedding ceremony. Love them!
Love this sandal! Fits well & very nice!
Cute and overall comfortable, the embellishments however dig into the toes. I wore these for just a couple hours and they actually wore painful sores on each side.
Love them,seemed a little high at first,but very balanced and adjusted to the height quickly,very comfy
I love them . order another pair.
Very comfortable!
Beautiful and comfortable.  If they were a little narrower they would be even better.
Good Fit!  Very pretty!
Great shoes love them!!!
I am a die hard sketchers fan ,but have to give three stars on these because they just were not for me ,fit comfort and quality were all there but I didnt like the style these shoes exposed all of my feet and toes the design is more focused on the top of feet which leaves the toes just hanging bare ,,,Im not one who love my toes to be the center of attention ...lol...so I returned them ,but if you like your toes being the design of the shoe then you will love these ,just not foe me
It's comfortable
I love these shoes, but I wear them a lot and they are squishing on the heel of the shoe.
I just love them. They're comfy and look great.
Beautiful shoe. Skechers are the best. Same amazing fit with a bit of glam. This is my go to shoe when I want comfort with some bling.
They r cute and comfy
I got lots of complements and can dress them up or down. Jeans or a dress they go with everything.
I will wear these until they fall apart. Hopefully that won't happen soon. They are adorable and fit me perfectly.
Very comfy and stylish!
Awesome flip flops and I like the heel. I wear an 8 and fit perfect. Like the gem stones, very pretty.
Bought several Skechers shoes before to size but these run small
horrible fit... will be returning... the arch is almost into the heel... can't belive these are sketchers...guess I'll stick to the tennishoe ... not wedges
Great shoe. Love them.
Bought for my mom, she loved them!
I have been looking for 3 yrs
Just as I expected.  I wear them as dressy sandals with my summer long skirts and tight legged pants.
I have had these for less than a month, only wearing them to church and work a couple of times.  The gems are falling off, not good quality!
The upper part rubs alittle but not bad. Otherwise comfortable.  I would recommend them.  Saw lady in Cabo on vacation with them and when I returned home I went to Amazon to look for them.  ;)
Cute, fit well and the comfort you'd expect from a sketchers product.
It's light on my feet, and I alway  loved  Skechers.
Most comfortable shoe.  Very easy to walk in
They are one of my favorite shoes to wear.
beautiful
Unfortunately I had to return these shoes as the strap was too tight across the top of the foot.
The strap is rubber. It gave me blisters
Love them
Love these shoes! they are very cute and comfortable but the heel height is a little higher that I had hoped at 4'  I am 5'9 so I will be returning them...sad face!
Love them!!!
Based on other reviews I read, I was hesitant to buy these shoes.  But, for the price I thought I would give it a try knowing I can always return them to Amazon.  Others had stated they were very uncomfortable and cut-in around the ankle or toes. I have not noticed it. I wore them all day to work - more than 10 hours.  I walked a solid mile in them (literally) and had very little discomfort - for the first day in them I'm pretty impressed.  I do have a high tolerance for wearing heels though.  The sole is slippery, I will say that, it has a fabric insert at the ball of the foot which makes it such - similar to other brands like Tom's - you just need to be aware of it.
nice to look at
Love, love, love sketchers - love this new design - once spring comes I wear these all summer until the weather gets colder.
I cannot stand these shoes, although I really hoped I would like them.  I think the design is very cute; however, they are far too painful to wear for even a few minutes. The sizing seems to be really off, and I ended up purchasing a pair that are a full size larger than my normal size, only to find out they still won't fit!  The shoe seems to be very poorly made, and the thong is not located in the proper place for the shoe size.  It is too far back, and cuts into the skin between my toes in a very painful way.  However, the base of the shoe is a little too large, probably because the shoe is a size larger than what I normally wear.  It's all because of where that thong is located, that makes this a painful, ill-fitting, cheaply-made shoe.
Just go with a 1/2 size larger if possible.
These ran at least 1/2 size too small. Unfortunately I had to return these.
Disappointed with the quality. The material on top came up easily after little use.
I was looking for a pair of flip flops that also gave me a couple inches of height and these fit the bill perfectly. They are super comfortable and seem to be getting better and better as I wear them. I would give this product 5 stars if it had a less plastic-y look. Would love to see these made with leather but still use Skechers' foam technology. Overall, they pair with almost any outfit and you can wear them all day.
Stretch out too quick. Became a sloppy fit within 4 times wearing.
Loved how these shoes feel but my heel slipped off the back and that just didn't work out for me. They are super cute and comfortable for sandals with a heel.
Great color. Standard classic to wear with anything. Love the memory foam!
Because of the memory foam padding my foot feels like it falls to one side or the other which makes me walk funny in these shoes. I do not like as much as the other sketcher sandals I own.
Just as expected, good look, comfortable.
I have many shoes from Skechers and have not ever had a problem with quality... these shoes are a different story.  After wearing them for only a month the lining on the footbed has peeled off.  They are so uncomfortable to wear I cannot use them.  It will definitely make me reconsider Skechers in the future as to whether the quality is still there.
The cushion got torn after just a week. I hope it is just a defective pair.
Strap to loose
Did not fit properly even though I purchased the correct size, I think they run a half to a full size small. The strap is a coarse material that hurts your skin after a very short time. The center toe strap seems misplaced and the foot is nearly an inch from being properly on the shoe. Item returned.
Love these!!!
I love the Skechers wedge heel thong sandals!! They are the perfect summer sandal. I have several different pair.  I've been buying them for several years now. They are comfortable enough that I can wear them all day and I especially love the wedge heel.
The most comfortable sandal I own.  I buy a new one every year!
Fits well, I have a wide foot and this accommodates, the support and slip is off a bit...
Very cute! I accidently ordered two pairs so my best friend made out.
I love these sandals!!  As usual, Skechers has the edge on some of the most comfortable shoes available in the market.  I highly recommend the wedge sandals.  They are as cute as they are comfortable.
I only gave it a 3 stars because size came small I had to exchange to the next size up and not crazy about the elastic strap.
I love the color with a little sparkle. Very comfortable.can wear shopping or a night out.
Love sketchers.but I miss judge my size and bought a 11 .it was so big.so I bought a size 10 my size in a different style it fit so perfect.do sketchers is true to size.buy your right size ok
Exactly what I was wanting!
These shoes are very comfortable and I love the bright colors!
Mother's Day gift to my mother-in-law.  She loves them!!!
Love the style but they were about a half size too small. I'll be shipping them back for a half size larger than I normally wear.  First time I've been disappointed in sketcher products.
I love these shoes they fit great, are light and I can wear them for hours!
It's good
These shoes really look good however I've tried them on several times in my house and the straps are elastic and just &#34;dig&#34; into your feet. I'm afraid that if I use them, I will have blisters. So as cute as they are I think I should return them.
Runs a little on the small side.  Go up half a size if possible.
I like the shoe and I like the cushioning, but the elastic is too tight on my foot and my toes start to lose circulation after a while.  Maybe it's just my fat feet, but I don't think these will be my new favorite shoes like I was hoping they'd be. :(
Really comfy
Very comfortable.
Goooooooooood.
Got on lightning deal so very happy with purchase. Cute style and very comfie...hoping they don't stretch out as others reported. Being very careful about not shuffling into them too hard which would cause the foot to move down and thus stretch them!
Love them.. So comfortable
Cute. Good basics for jeans. Just wanted some height without the high heel pain. Done!
Initially ordered a sz 7, then returned & ordered an 8. I have 2 other pairs of Skechers that I love, but these don't really compare to the comfort of my other pairs. This is because the woven top band feels &#34;scratchy&#34; against my skin. So, that's not really a &#34;deal breaker,&#34; but it's a little annoying.
never thought at my age I could wear a heel again, but these were great.  try em girls, they are great.
Disappointing fit, but cute shoe..I would definitely go a size larger.
Usually wear a 9.5.  Ordered a 10.  They aren't big at all and I really wish they were a 1/2 size larger..<br />That being said, the feel, fit, support is great.
Lovely shoes. Gift for my daughter. Fit quite well. Delivery was very quick. No problems with .<br />Thank you
good
Love Skechers!!! Especially the wedges!!
Love these!  I am so proud that Skechers has made memory foam &#34;cute shoes&#34;.
Love them
I am on my feet all day working retail. I like that I can wear them and my feet don't hurt by the end of the day.
Very comfortable with the memory foam sole
The top part material is way to ridge, I wish would be soften. But I love the shoes and the colors.
I need to take them to a shoe tailor to hopefully tighten the material!  I love the shoe and colors, but the wide band has not support and my feet/toes slide out!
Very comfortable.
Would have loved to keep these. They are really cute. Just not tight enough to hold my foot. The woven part was too loose andmy foot slid too far forward. My toes were about hanging off the edge as I walked. Really liked the look and comfort of the foot bed. So sad I had to return.
I love the shoe, however it is too small. Since it doesn't come in half sizes, I should have ordered it in a size 8. But, I always take a 7-7 & 1/2. This is Anthony's wife.
Incredible shoes! I never want to take them off! They are extremely comfortable and very stylish! They go with maxi dresses or yoga pants and look fantastic! Sketchers brand has a monopoly on comfort....no joke! I own 5 different types of shoes, and they're all Sketchers! ðŸ˜ƒ
I have several pairs of wedge Skechers, and over time I've found that they don't hold my foot as secure as I'd like. I decided to give these a try. I purchased in taupe/lavender here (misidentified as taupe/silver). The images here are correct but the described colors are not. Just google taupe/lavender and taupe/silver before purchasing.<br /><br />THE GOOD. The upper is stretchy but snug and hugs my foot nicely. Like other Skechers wedges like Cali, they are comfy & walkable. But this one especially so because of the memory foam.<br /><br />THE BAD. Although I actually LOVE THEM, the elastic is too forgiving. I tried a bit of walking with these, and my foot is very quickly going forward. These Skechers suffer from the same problem that I've had with others. Although they are uber comfortable, they don't hold your foot as secure as you might want.<br /><br />MY ADVICE. If you like Skechers wedges, give them a try. If you find the elastic or neoprene in a Skechers wedge gives too much (or, breaks down over time), then simply pass.
The strap across the top is tight. Real tight. They look nice and seem well made but there just isn't enough room for my toes to be comfortable.
The reason I said I could only wear them several hours is becaus I have a foot that had several surgeries and is smaller than the other foot and is fused so I can't move it very much.  It is very hard for me to find shoes, especially sandals that will work for me.  I have had better success with the Skechers Brand and these sandals are no exception.  They are very comfortable. I'm sure if you had normal feet, you could wear them as long as you wanted.
The top part rubs on my toes a bit and it's hard so it needed a bandaid. I still wear them sometimes because they offer good support otherwise.
I usually wear 8.5 but sometimes Skechers run small, so I got a 9m - but this shoe is NOT wide. I thought getting a size up and wide would fit well but it didn't. Otherwise it's a good shoe. One I get it stretched out I'm sure I'll like them. Just disappointed at the fit but didn't want to bother with an exchange.
Love them very good quality.
spectacular sandals you were my wife.
loved them- had to get a bigger size but they are still very comfortable
These sandals are exactly what I've been looking for--comfortable, cute shoes that feel good to walk in. They're also a good fit for my hard-to-fit-feet.
They are very comfortable and look good too; would recommend them.
These shoes were bought for my daughter and after she wore them for a day she called me.  She said these were the most comfortable sandals she has ever worn.  She has a problem keeping slip on sandals on her feet so I ordered these and she just loves them.
Have not worn them a lot yet, but I do like them.  They seem to be a little tight across the top of the big toe , but maybe they will stretch after more wear.  They are very cushiony!
Too stiff material.
Nice and comefortable.. I highly recomment it
Great shoes, fit like a glove.  They don't come off your feet like other sandals do. Very comfortable.
With two artificial knees and an artificial hip, I only wear Skechers.
a bulky fitting show
Wonderful shoes! Love them!
Comfortable Skechers footbed but strap is way too long at toe area.  I have average to wide feet, not skinny/narrow feet but the toe strap pops up about an inch above my foot.  It looks/feels odd, so I rarely wear them.  I love most of my Skechers but their sizing/fit is highly inconsistent.
Very comfortable fit. Love the memory foam. Can walk long distances without discomfort. Wider on top which worked great for me, I have high arch so extra room prevented rubbing.
Not true to size.  I own other Shetcher sandals in size 6. These did not fit.
I would like to return these sandals, there was no paperwork included with this item, so am not sure just how to proced to return this item.
I add all arch supports to my shoes.
Comfortable shoe, but lacking adequate arch support.
Super comfortable
So comfortable and light. Love them.
Quality and colour is great.  Bought a size smaller because I didn't want it to be big.  I have narrow feet. Very comfortable.
It's excellent
Love, love those Skechers, and these didn't disappoint. Comfortable and a great color.
The straps across the shoes  have stretched  and they are hard to stay on  I love the shoe  and the comfort they feel on my feet but I don't like that the straps have stretched
Fit great very comfortable and was delivered on time.
love sketchers shoes.
Very comfortable. Like the memory foam footbed
Wonderful shoes, so comfortable.  Absolutely love them.
I like these shoes in general. They are not as stylish as they appeared in the photo but they are more comfortable than anticipated. They are more difficult to slip on than regular flip flops and they weirdly do not stay on the foot as well as regular flip flops. The memory foam is delightful, though, so I am keeping them and wearing them regularly :)
I returned them because I did not like the way they felt.
SKETCHERS ARE THE BEST
The shoes are nice and comfortable but order a size larger than you normally wear. I not going to return them because I using them as house slippers.
Very comfy....love them.
very disappointed they donâ€™t come in half sizes
Love these sandals!!! I bought them because I saw them on a friend at work and she raved about them. She was 100% correct. Very comfortable, great arch support and fit just right. Only problem?.... just come in black :-(
Fit great. Very comfortable
I wear a 10 in all Skechers, but these in a 10 were way to small.  I sent them back and did not even try to get a bigger side.
Love them. I am on concrete floors all day.
Very comfortable to wear all day long.
Love these. The memory foam is great feeling
very comfortable, your feet sink into lots of memory foam with every step !
I have these in the grey and they are really comfortable that is why I ordered the blue.  My feet/legs don't get tired while wearing them.
Very comfortable , can wear whole long day.
Very comfortable. I usually don't care for thong sandals, I took a chance and I love them. I have plantar fascitis and they offer good support.
I wore these when I first got them - really liked the look.  I was trying to replace some Sketchers sandals that were kind of like them (which I can't find anymore and loved!!)  I wore them for a bit and after a few hours though I started to get blisters on the insides.  I know more shoes need to be worn in so I'm keeping them and trying again after the blisters heal.  I have wider feed so I'm sure that's why they didn't fit quite right.<br /><br />Now that they are better I'm going to wear them again and see if they've stretched a bit and won't hurt so bad - if not I'll have to pass them on to my sister's kids who might be able to wear them.<br /><br />UPDATED -------&#62;  I have let them wear in a little bit - after my blisters healed I tried again and they were much more comfortable.  Now I wear them everywhere and I like them a lot.<br /><br />Cute design though.
The toe pieces are too tight
Very comfortable  Will order another pair
The inside strap rubbed a blister on my foot.  I'll have to figure out how to prevent that.  It was only in one place but I had to stop wearing them until it healed.  It's a shame because I got a lot of compliments on them.
Skechers is a brand that I trust to be comfortable, stylish, dependable and reasonably priced.
love how comfortable they are..
Memory foam is comfortable but nonsupportive, no arch support.
Love these sandals!
Excellent. Quick shipping.
These sandals are as I expected they would be. I have worn Sketchers sandals previously and these did not disappoint. delivery from amazon spot on. will buy more from amazon and sketchers.
These shoes do not come in a narrow size, so I on purpose ordered a smaller size just for that reason, and that worked for me.  My heels and toes come near the ends of the shoes, but that's okay because the straps on this shorter pair fit my skinny feet snuggly; the size I normally wear were too wide in these shoes.  They are a well-made shoe with good arch support!  They're so comfortable that I can wear them most all day.  I like them so well that I now have two pairs.
Comfortable and attractive.
I wear them all the time
Not what I expected for this brand
Ilove them
Nice sandal.  Very comfortable
Too tight and my felt they were sliding.
These are the most comfortable shoes I have had in a long time. As a teacher, I am on my feet all day long and these sandals will surely help me out!
Super comfy and stylish
Very comfy
Feels good on my feet.
These are not nearly as comfortable as other skechers sandals I own.
Most comfortable sandals of all the skechers out there.
Second pair, Need I say more? Just love the memory foam comfort. Great support for a flip flop. These were a great price, too!
I am not sure these foam sandals will support me very long. I have about 20 days to determine if this is true.
GREAT SHOES. I WANT EVERY COLOR
Love these. So comfortable, ended up buying in black also!
Extremely comfortable!
Sketchers are the best for loving your feet and these shoes are no exception. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 through no fault of the shoes. I have narrow feet, so the fit is a little wide for me, but I can still wear them comfortably. If your feet width is normal or a little wide, these shoes will be heaven for you. They'll also give you an inch or two in height, which is nice cuz I'm short.
Very comfortable.
I have similar Skechers in a size 7 1/2, so that's what I ordered, and they were way too small, so I returned them.  Lovely shoes otherwise, but not ready to make another mistake.
I still need to break them in, as they still hurt a little between my big toe.
I love these sandles because they fit well and are very comfortable.  A great product at a great price.
They are very nice,  the 7 fits a 7.5 perfect
The shoes fit fine, but If I were to order them again, I would probably get a larger size. I usually wear a 10 in Skechers, but these are a little snug. I'm thinking they will stretch like most shoes do.
I wish Sketchers made wide width sandals.
I do not know about the arch support because I could not wear them long enough to find out.  They were TOO TIGHT!
I have feet problems and these were great.  I could wear all day.
Very comfortable in the heel ,they seem to run small. I normally ware a size 10, but these seem to be more like a 9 1/2  with a small big toe hole<br />I will keep these maybe they will. Loosen up a little while wearing.
I had a great experience
Most comfortable sandals ever. Got them in 3 colors
Very comfortable.  I love the memory foam sole.  Very cute too!  They seemed tight when I first put them one but are very comfortable after an hour of so.  Good support as well.  I can wear them to work and then take my daughter for a walk to the park in these and not be uncomfortable at all.
They need to offer an 8.5 in this shoe (I'm a 8.5M). I bought a 9 and it was too big. I bought the 8M-it was better but notgreat. I keep them because I needed house shoes. Please offer in 1/2 sizes
Sketchers sandals never let me down. These are comfortable for the woman who doesn't like to wear heels and who still wants a nice pair of sandals. These are dressy enough to get away with with dress pants and casual enough for everyday use. The best part of these are that the straps are slightly elastic, so instead of feeling like it's going to fly off your foot, it sits snugly without being too tight. I have flat feet and am an average size 8. My feet are slightly wider/fatter than most women and these still look and feel very nice. Sketchers make the best sandals.
Size 8 was to small for me, but I still liked the shoe.  I ended up giving these to my son's girlfriend and then reordered a black pair in size 9.  They fit great and I love them
Great fit at a great price.  I love skechers.
Great fit love the dream foam
They are nice shoes.  They are just tight when putting them on.
Great.
Absolutely love these. They are very comfortable.
My foot slips out if the sandal because the fabric is shiny.  No arch support. Looks like the sandal has a slight heel but it is flat.
These shoes are great. I wish the straps were a bit more soft and stretchy but I'm getting used to that.
Looked amazing, but when my wife tried them on, both her feet kind of tilted to the inside in these. We own 9 pairs of Sketchers between both of us and our daughter, and no other type does this. We had to return them. Really too bad, they looked and felt awesome. Well try some more variants on at some stores to see if it was a defect or a design flaw.
Comfortable.  Good fit.  Average arch support.
VERY comfortable.
I love anything Skechers so I am not surprised that I loved these too!  Very comfortable with memory foam.
Loved them. Very comfortable.
I'll give for 4 stars instead of 5 because unfortunately didn't fit at all, the straps are somewhat narrow and way too tight for me. However my mother says that this sandals are super comfy and the memory foam is great, feeling like walking on clouds. Given the fact that her feet are very thin I consider that these sandals are not suitable for people with wide feet (like me).
Love them ... Very comfortable and cute
They're about a half size longer than what i ordered, but they are wide, like i hoped.<br />they feel too tight for about an hour, then stretch out.<br />they're very nice.
I have two pair of Sketcher's sandals and I wanted to order another pair, but in the wake of the dog and cat slaughters in China, where they are made, I refuse to order anything else made in China.
I did add an arch support for sandals that I found online. These are really comfortable and cute. I am wearing them all day as I have trouble with my heels hurting (plantar fasciitis). I have tried wearing my other flip flops and find I cannot. These are really comfortable and help a great deal with the fasciitis. I will probably purchase again.
Cute and comfy
Good to wear for all day walking
I love the memory foam sole!  I work on my feet for most of the day, and these sandals give me extra support compared to any others I've worn.  The straps have some give while walking, and are more comfortable than leather.  These have quickly become my favorites!
I had blisters on both feet on the first day and within a very short time when I wore this pair of sandals.  Had to buy bandages just so that I can return home with my groceries.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and since I am not residing in America, I will not be able to return it as the postage will be very expensive.
Are definitely not for not stopping walking, just casual strolling.
Perfect fitting
Great sandals!
Memory foam soles are amazing.
My new go to shoe!!  Great height that you can wear all day long.  Cute design.
Very comfortable
I couldnt get my foot in the shoe. I wear a 9 in all my shoes and this one was sized wrong
I'm an 8 1/2 ordered 9, slightly too big.  Reordered in 8- fit perfect!
The straps are tight and blister my feet. I'm hoping they stretch a little so I can wear them. The soles are very comfortable.
Love them!!!
EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!
Fitflops these are not...I had hoped they would be a good shoe, but they fit oddly and I sent them back
The sandals are a great find for my needs; family caregiver to elderly parent, living in the desert and wanting my feet to breathe!  I can also have a sciatica (attack) if my feet don't stay happy.  These fit the bill.
received the shoes in a timely manner. While the fit is a little narrow, the cushioning in the inner sole is amazing!
Very comfortable
I sent these back, I was super disappointed.  Too small and uncomfortable
These looked really cute and comfortable. I read the reviews and decided I would purchase them. I was disappointed when they arrived. They were large and wide. They looked like boats on my feet. I requested to return them. Be aware that seller does not pay return shipping! However, after I explained my disappointment and concerns in more detail, seller sent prepaid return label.
My daughter stole these from me as soon as they arrived. I will be getting me a pair too. They are perfect for the summer!!
I love the comfort these sandals provide, you can wear them all day long.
Comfortable and stylish
Very comfortable footbed.  Cute too!  If your foot pronates to the inside, you should pass on these.
Very comfotable, love these sandals!
Ordered same size as previous sandal (although different style). At first, fit tightly but not uncomfortably. After wearing once, though, I ended up with an open sore on the inner aspect of my left foot.
I love the look of these shoes. They do run small and tight and I will be returning them for a larger size
Need assistance in returning for diff. Color, pleez
Very comfortable
love them!
Comfy and stylish. Toe strap does not rub..in fact I forget thet are there! Well worth the price.
I like these sandals. Very comfy. I ordered a half size larger than I usually wear and the sandal fits well. My normal size would have been too small.
I'm in awe with the Skechers shoes that have Memory Foam. I usually have 2 pair of descent tennis shoes with arch support that I wear to work... Now I have about 8 pairs of shoes now with MF and I can wear them all day without any foot or knee problems.
Love my sandals.
I ordered the next size because they felt so good with the memory foam in them.
Great looking, super comfy, my only bummer is where the big toe goes in the loop major blisters my first day out, wear a bandaid your first time out. Sketchers, you should make that loop a little stretchy.
Awesome fit and comfortable enough to wear all day.
Very comfortable, stylish and easy to walk in.  These are on their way to being my summer favorites.
I wear a &#34;B&#34; width between a 6 1/2 to a 7 inches size and usually order a size 7 in the skechers sandals. I read one review that said the sandals fit a little large. Since all the size 7 were sold out I opted for the size 6. Really glad I did. These fit so perfect. They are so comfortable and I did not even have to break them in. I do not have a model's foot but I have to say these sandals really made my feet look great! I have had several people comment on &#34;I love those sandals&#34; is that the new memory foam from skechers's?&#34;   They really look classy and that blue is like a denim blue and looks so cute with cropped jeans. Gives you added height too. These are now my favorite skechers sandals at the moment. I am seriously contemplating buying in other colors I like them so much! I highly recommend these sandals. You will love them!  UPDATE: I just bought 2 more colors. I bought the grey color in size 7 and olive in size 6.  The size 7 which is my normal size in skechers really was okay but a little big. So when I bought  the olive green I bought the size 6 and I love how it fits. The olive green really looks like the color tan. Now that is great for me. I only chose olive green because they did not list the tan as an alternate color. So happy that the olive green is really more of a light tan color. Very happy with that fact .  So now I am proud owner of 3 of these.  I love them that much.
purchased this for my Cruise, 5 days of walking around the ship and ports.  It was perfect.  In and out of the salt water, and no damage.
Very comfy and fit perfect
Not sure I like them.

These shoes were very comfortable initially, however the quality is not what I expected. The first time I wore them, the strap rubbed a blister on the side of my foot. I determined that it was caused by the little decal that has the size number printed on it, so I tried to scrape that off. That helped. However, after just 2 or 3 weeks, the fabric on the sole came away from the memory foam, which made them impossible to continue wearing. Having loose fabric sliding around under my foot causes more blisters. I have had other Skechers brand sandals before and loved them, so I was disappointed that these did not work out for me.
Have gotten skechers for the past few summers, similar model. These were very comfortable initiallt. However, after less than 8-10 times wearing them, the elasticity is gone and the sandal barely stays on.
Very comfy- plenty of cushion for walking a lot.
i'd buy again
I ordered this Skechers sandals as a last minute purchase before going in vacation.  I knew I'd be doing a lot of walking.  I couldn't find any sandals that I liked here locally that had the memory foam and was very happy when I did on Amazon.  I got them before the date given.  They're very comfortable and light.  The elastic straps on my right foot seem a little snug at first.  After wearing them for the first time, they felt just right.  I don't like flat sandals.  The fact they have a good height heel (about 1 1/2 inch) and wedge sole gives it a nicer casual look than flat sandals. I'm able to walk without having to balance my step as I walk.  They're sturdy and well made.  The olive color is a soft shade and pretty much can be worn with any color outfit providing you're not obsessed with matching with your outfit too much.  Im more with comfort than anything else.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  I love Sketchers footwear.  You can't go wrong.
Love them, very comfortable
I love Sketchers products. The arch supports are great.
I love Skechers and I love this sandal. will wear nothing else all summer.
I love them. Comfortable and cute too!
These shoes are very comfortable. The cost was very reasonable making these sandals very affordable.
Love the shoes
Did not fit right.
Great sandal.
feet swell then shoes become tight.
Great shoes!
They are soft and comfortable. They don't &#34;hug&#34; your feet the way you would think they might, looking at the picture and how far back the straps go. Comfy anyway.
This slipper fits great. It is very comfortable and soft. The only problem I had was that it flaps and makes a sound when I walk...but other than that it is an excellent product. Gives lots of support for people with heel spurs and Achilles tendonitis
Perfect
Picture looks brown but sandal is black with silvery/gray stitch design. They fit well on my narrow-med feet. A wide foot may not fit well unless it comes in wide, but I dont see any complaints about that. I'm 5ft2 so I looked all over for 1-2&#34; sole with no heel for comfort and height. These work well for that! For me. They r perfect compared to everything else out there. I didnt want to spend that much, but needed them for their good comfort, height and appearance. I will be wearing these allot! Thank you Sketcher for your great styles and workmanship. You put 'real' thought in making them work well. I appreciate that compared to all the careless junk shoes out there.
These are very cute and awesome comfort.
I wear a 6 1/2, but a seven works well. The memory foam is great.
I wear an 8 1/2 but since only whole sizes are offered, I went to the 9. It's a little big but I can live with it. Better than being too small.
My wife loves these sandals. Extremely comfortable.
Great , very comfortable
So comfortable I love these ! If your a 7 your heel will be to the edge. I could have gone a 1/2 size bigger. All I ever get is sketcher shoes/sneakers - these so far are the most comfortable.
LOVE
very comfortable
Very comfortable. Order size up for half sizes.
I am a size 8.5 and wear a B width, although my feet run narrow.  After reading other reviews I ordered down a size nd the 8 was too short.  I exchanged them for a 9 and the fit is perfect.  For those of you with narrower feet these are great, fit snug.  It takes a little getting used to the toe strap, as I have not worn flip flops for years.  But it's worth it, the sandals are extremely cushioney and soft.  Perfect for anyone with a back problem.  They are also a very attractive shoe.
I probably needed a size 6 1/2
I love the look of this sandal.  The foot bed was soft and I'm sure would have been comfortable but it was very narrow.  I felt like my feet were hanging off the edges.  I do not wear wide width shoes and don't consider myself having wide feet.
Love them!
They run a bit small. But don't come in half sizes
I normally wear a size 71/2 and so I went with the size 8 since there are no 1/2 sizes.<br />They are too big and flop at my heel when walking, I will check to see if I can return for size 7.<br />I really love the look of the shoes but there just to big.
I usually wear a 9.5 in tennis shoes and was worried that the 9 would be too tight. We I first put them on, they were a bit tight, but they loosened up just enough to be very comfortable.
So comfortable I wear them all day and it has really helped my feet!
Love these sandals.  I receive many compliments.
Cool looking comfy sandal.
Color ok, did not know I had only 30 days to try them, I ordered them in March and we still had snow, I could not return end of april.
They are very cute but the top strap is not soft like the rest of the sketchers I have. This one is stiff and cuts into the top of my foot. Huge blister after an hour.
Fits well
I Love These They Are Perfect!!!!
Nice shoe. Very comfortable.
I love this particular Skechers foot bed.  I don't know why they don't continue to make new ones.  But I am grateful I can still find existing inventory on Amazon!  The foot bed is like walking on supportive clouds.  I bought a pair in the orange and brown and a pair in the off white.  They are aptly named, they do have a &#34;granola&#34; feel about them.  Not crazy about the orange and brown, but for the comfort, I am willing to put up with the not-so-cute appearance.
As always Sketchers came through again with their sketcher sandal. Fits perfectly and very comfortable. I have 10 pairs of the sketcher relax  fit/tone up flops and now the sandal. Taking sandals to Europe with me...could not ask for a better shoe for comfort and walking.:)
comfy foot sole...
thank you
I had to return them as they were too large and the next size smaller was unavailable.
love them, but might buy a 7, im usually an 8 1/2!! foots slips forward, will put a gel insert on the ball of the foot, very cute, just  like walking on the clouds,<br />will buy the black in a 7 to compare
This shoe is very comfortable.  I wear them for work all day, but I sit throughout most of the day.  The only hang up I have is my big toe hits the front side a little and that can irritate my toe.  But otherwise, they look great and feel pretty good.  I am a true 7 and they fit perfect.  They are almost on the small side.  So if you're in between a size, I would go up a size.
Must buy these if your feet hurt in the pretty shoes. These are so awesome.
Ordered my normal size of 8, shoe toe strap was huge & didn't even touch my foot & wouldn't have even with the thickest of socks.  Maybe a size 7 or 6 might have fit.  They just flopped on my foot that I couldn't even walk in them so I gave them away brand new.
For the most very comfortable. Very soft.  Love the way they look.  The wide strap tends to get a little tight by the end of the day.
The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn because of the memory foam.
Extremely comfortable!!
I have a narrow foot so the straps were a bit large fitting.  They're comfortable.
I normally wear a 61/2 to 7 and this size 6 fits me perfectly. I absolutely love these sandals. They are so comfortable that I ordered a second pair as a &#34;backup&#34; for when these wear out.
I usually wear a size 8-9, but I bought a size 7 for these. They fit perfectly, my foot reaches the edges perfectly. I wish they did come in half sizes. I am surprised I wear a size 7 though so luckily I tried these on in a store first. These shoes I can wear all day, I can even run in them if needed. They are even more comfortable than flats and sandals I wear to work, that I have started wearing these instead. They do not make my feet sweat like flats or other heels, to wear my feet would usually slide forward. I would have gotten the size 8, but the heel strap seemed really loose when I tried them in store. I want these shoes in every color!!<br /><br />PRO: Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, can wear them all day with no achy feet.<br />CONS: Sizing.
These shoes are a pleasant surprise.  I was expecting them to fit snug and they fit my wide foot perfect.  The straps are not too tight.  The picture does not do these shoes justice.  They are very cute on and they are very comfortable.
very nice
Great pair of shoes!  Life with heels should have always been this easy!
Comfortable enough for several hours and attractive enough to wear with dresses.
I cannot get over how comfortable these shoes are! They are so pretty and go with everything. If I had my way I'd go on a sketcher's sandal shopping spree! Definitely surpassed what I was expecting.
The shoe fits great, the toe strap is extremely big, my pinky toe comes out.
Very wide
I really like how light and comfortable these shoes are. I am also impressed with the padding on the insoles, and how long I can wear them without foot or leg stress. The only reason I gave it four stars was because the striped ankle wrap is a little uncomfortable at first and took a while to get used to. Other than that, it seems great. :D
They are really nice but since they don't have half sizes, I ordered the 9... I wear 8.5 so they are slightly loose and after walking a long distance, my foot shifts to the side.  Attractive and would be perfect if the size was right.
I have been wearing them all day and it feels like I am walking on clouds. I don't know if they are going to last a long time, but the comfort alone is definitely worth the price. I also think that they are very cute.
these are great, very light weight! So fashionable!! Love them.
Love the shoes!
Very cute shoes, but the elastic is really tight.  By the end of the day, my feet look pretty mangled.
Cute light weght shoe.  Inner sole is very soft.  I like this stylist shoe
I find these shoes to be very comfortable.  I bought them to wear with summer dresses and they look cute.  I did notice however that your foot slides forward a little when walking.  I think the bottom strap is a  too roomy.  I wear a size five.
Most comfortable sandals EVER!
These shoes are comfortable and they fit my fairly wide foot. The top portion will somewhat dig into your foot but not enough to make it uncomfortable-it just leaves an elastic mark on the foot. I also like that they have an anti microbial footed. They really do not smell when you wear them all day. I also like that I can dress them up or down with varying outfits. I wish they came in multiple colors such as brown and red.
LOVE these shoes!!  The memory foam padding is so comfortable!  I was worried that the padding would make my feet sweat or would cause the shoe to stink over time but neither has happened.  They are dressy looking and I even ordered a second pair in the black color.
Very confortable.Even when the weather is humid the feet is confortable.I've buy another pair to be sure that next summer I will wear them again !!!
Comfortable but not for me.They are very lightweight, but they are more casual than I thought.
love Sketchers shoes so comfy
Cute sandle with total comfort.
They feel very comfortable, I love how it feels on my feet.
These are the most comfortable wedges I have ever worn! Love these sandals! They may run a bit large, but since I wear a 9-1/2 I went up to a 10 based on other reviews I had read. They also run wide which is perfect for me! I had foot surgery last year and have been searching for a comfortable and attractive sandal with a little heal. This was the perfect choice!
I am on my feet at work most of the day. I can wear these all day and my feet are comfortable all day. They have great support!
Very comfortable shoes.  I have a high instep and because the strap is slightly stretchy, I was able to get  these on my foot.  I had been wearing Sketchers for years because they were cut a bit wider which made them comfortable for me but some of the newer, cuter styles were too tight.  These are back to the wider shoe.  Love them!!!
Love the shoes,great style and comfortable as well
I have severe foot arthritis and big toe problems.  The ONLY shoes I can wear all day are New Balance walking shoes.  That being said,  these skecher wedges are the ONLY higher heel shoe I can wear at all.
It's a birthday gift from my husband to me so haven't worn yet but I think they will be very comfortable!
I bought these shoes because I am a Skechers fan (have the flat ones in all colors) and wanted something very super comfortable and dressy to attend the BELMONT RACES in New York last Saturday for the Triple Crown.  The lower strap was too wide (but my feet are narrow, so it may fit medium/normal size feet).  The top row of the upper strap cut into my foot above my ankle, so my daughter cut off 1 1/2 of the top white layer and it did not affect the support of the shoes.  If you cut off the top white layer and leave the clear plastic, it will irritate your foot, so she cut into the second white layer and then it was fine.  I wore these shoes from 10 am to 10pm on Saturday and then again out to dinner on Sunday.  I have acute spinal stenosis, and these wedge sandals were wonderful for my back.  Normally I cannot wear a wedge for more than a 1/2hr......they lasted 12 hours with no pain....  Would be nice if the sole was white as well, but comfort was my primary need and it fitted that very well.
Very comfortable.  Love the sandals.
Love love these. So comfortable. I feel like I am not wearing shoes....
definitely a pretty comfortable shoe and the memory foam sole is amazing, but the elastic is pretty loose and my foot slips around in the shoe while walking. I do not have a narrow foot and I wouldn't call it wide, it's just not holding my foot in place well enough for me.
Great shoes runs small.
These are super comfortable with just the right height for me.  Love them!
Runs small, comfortable but not for me.
Love these shoes!!! Very comfortable even wore them during 8 hrs of performances for a local church I was doing. Lots of time on my feet. I will say that arch support is good not great. I have plantar fasciatis and did have issues after that 8 hrs on my feet, but I have had it worse. Ultimately these are a fun design and with the memory foam it makes them incredibly comfortable to wear all day.
Lovely shoe just the wrong size and not the opportunity to return for correct size as amazon .com
Love them
They are very lightweight, but they are more casual than I thought.
They were very comfortable, but had to return them because the front strap was too big.
So comfortable! Feel like I'm walking on fluffy pillows. Top clear strap near my ankle could have been designed to be a less wide strap. However, I still really like them! Perfect sandal for my Achilles tendinitis. Wish they would make them in a nude color.
I love these sandals! They are so comfortable, I wore them to work where I stand all day and my feet never got sore. The wide band is stretchy but not too tight and the narrow band is not stretchy, it has a suede feel to it. I normally wear a 8 1/2 to 9 and the 9 in these fits perfectly.
So comfortable and easy to walk in. I ordered a second pair in a different color because I loved how comfortably they fit.
Comfortable.  Fits nicely but after several hours seems a little tight.  Probably not the fault of the shoe but my feet as that usually happens as the day goes on.  Would recommend them as Sketchers are a good brand.
So comfortable, but they don't have half sizes. I usually wear an 8 or 8.5, and the 8 is too big and the 7 too small. The toe strap is way too big, I can't imagine someone needed that much height for their toes. The heel strap seems more suited to someone with a very tall heel. That being said, they were still comfy enough to purchase, and feel great after a few days of wear. Hoping the ankle strap doesn't stretch out, because that is the only reason they work for me. I have a weird arch and it fits me well.
Excellent shoes, awesome memory foam padding, and my high arch is supported. I can't believe I found these shoes.
I love thes shoes the fit is good as I hoped it would be very fashion forward for a Skechers shoe! The only comment is the spongy feel although very comfortable you don't get the feel of support that I would have preferred I won't wear these everyday like I would if the felt more firm. Would still recommend them as they are adorable. Just be aware that they are stretchy and have a very soft walk.
They are excelent I love them
Love the feel of the shoe
Great Shoe
Super soft shoes ,fit perfect and modern pattern.
I love these!! Comfortable as a sneaker
I haven't worn heels for a long time but Skechers has given me a chance to try them again with their fabulous arch,
LOVE, These shoes ! Pretty, comfy,  looks and feels good on my feet :) !
I am a busy hairstylist and these are so comfortable to stand/walk in all day. Also stylish!
Its really soft and comfortable to wear. Its also very fashionable sandals and can wear in any kinds of clothers like jeans, skirts, shorts or skirts.. It matches perfectly.. Highly recommended!
So comfortable!  Good for people with normal to slightly wide feet.  Straps are not tight, so no need to &#34;break them in&#34;.
These shoes are like walking on clouds!  I loved my black pair so much I ordered the white ones as well.  LOVE THEM!
Perfect shoe completely cute! And very comfy!
Extremely happy with the purchase of these shoes.  They are stylish and extremely comfortable.  The added cushioning makes for extreme comfort.  The fit was perfect!
These are so awesome I had to order a second pair!
The strap is too loose and I'm trying to find a shoe repair person that can fix them, otherwise I may have to return them and I don't want to do that.
Love these shoes. They are so comfortable and they look great.
I usually wear a 6-1/2 or 7, but always have a hard time finding a perfect fit in shoes. I ordered a 7 in these as I own other Skechers in size 7 that are good. The length was good but the straps did not hold my feet in place. They were very loose around my foot and ankle. I had to return and no 6-1/2 was available.
UPDATE: Ok. After wearing them for a while, it happens that my feet are sliding to the front. Bummer...I will still wear them but the back strap of my smaller foot looks and feel sooo loose. Planning to get an insole or something to keep my foot in place.. Other Thant that they look ver pretty.  I wore them yesterday for my job (8-9 hrs). They are so light and comfortable!!. I am planning to order them in Black but probably half of a size smaller (8.5). My left foot is a bit smaller than the other, so I feel like it slides to the front a little. The quality of the material is excellent. They look so elegant and charming. The heel height is perfect for me. I felt like walking in clouds!!! I recommend them 200%!!!
Not only are these super cute, but they also are a truly comfortable shoe that I can wear most of the day. I have a hard time with shoes because my feet hurt so bad. Trying to find that elusive&#34;cute&#34; shoe that is comfortable is quite the chore and these fit the bill! Great for the upcoming summer season.
Very stylish wedge
They are super comfortable..
As with the previous review, this shoes runs very small.  I purchases it on a whim, hoping they would be a shoe that I could slip on, and run out the door.  I don't think so now.  I debated whether to return them.
Fits great!
I returned them.  They were WAY too small.  I am a standard size 10.  I ordered 3 various Sketchers sandals based on a friend telling me how comfortable they are, and all 3 were too small.  Various styles....I would say order up if you try them.  I am sad.
So adorable... Light and very comfortable!
Super comfortable and so cute!
I love these sandals. They are amazingly comfortable. I'm wearing them everywhere. I like them because they have a bit of a heel and look really cute and are really comfy. Perfect shoe.
They are higher then what I am used to wearing but knew this before I ordered.  They are very comfortable and feel great in them and are very good looking.  Received many compliments
Sole is super comfortable but a bit slippery. Takes some getting used to.
I used to love these shoes when they had rubber insoles.  The addition of memory foam sounded like a great idea but made the shoes much less comfortable for walking.  These used to be my go-to shoes for anything casual, including days with lots of walking.  The memory foam makes the shoes feel tight and slippery at the same time.  My feet tend to slide forward.  I bought a size larger and they are not tight now at all.  In fact they are too loose.  I miss the old shoes!
Very cute and comfortable. My 4th pair of sketchers this spring/summer.
I have a black pair from 3 years ago that have a different material for the foot bed and they fit much better.  I'm going to keep these because I think the memory foam will break in enough not to be uncomfortable but they definitely are more snug than my first pair.  If there were half sizes I would have ordered a 7 1/2 but since there isn't I think the 8 would be too large.  If I had paid $60 I would have returned them.
These are very comfortable. Bought to wear to a wedding 'cause I have Achilles problems and can't wear shoes w/ backs. They look dressy for flipflops. They seemed to be long @ the toes for a sz 10, but my toes are short. Probably could have worked in sz 9, but 10 is my usual Skechers size and I didn't have time to return and get them replaced.
About 1/2 size too small.  If ordering I would go up one size.  I don't like the hassle of returning an item.
I am on my 6th pair:)
nice sandals for the price. comfy insole.
Love these shoes! I also have a black pair.  They are comfortable.
Love these shoes.  I have the same ones I bought several years ago and they were looking a bit worn...because I wear them all the time.  So, I decided to buy another pair.  These are slightly different...a bit more cushy on the sole and has fabric unlike the older version, but I still love these shoes.  It appears to have some sort of arch support in them...which actually bothers me a bit, so the old version I liked better, but these are great and cute too!!!  You can wear casually or slightly dressed up.
I have bought two pairs of these shoes in the past and found them to be the most comfortable heel I have ever worn. However Sketchers has change the shoe and added memory foam that seemed to change the fit by about a half size.  I preferred the older version without the memory foam because the fit cradled my heel perfectly where my heel seems to hang over in the newer shoe
Not crazy about memory foam surprisingly enough. Had the kitty model and loved it. This one feels more awkward.
The footbed was really comfortable, as expected from Skechers Rumblers. For some reason, though, the strap between my big and second toe would dig in in such a painful way that I could not keep them. I wear thong-style sandals very often, and this rarely happens to me, so I'm disappointed.
I ordered a size 10 and they are more like an 8 I have had these shoes for 5 years now but got the memory foam ones this time. I was so disappointed they were so small. I love these shoes. don't know why these one's  where different the foam should have nothing to do with it. my foot hangs an inch off the back.
I do not like these Skechers with memory foam. My foot slides because the fabric slips. I cannot wear them
I love them. They are cute and not too casual to wear to work. The are super comfy and soft on the bottom of my feet. I did buy a 1/2 size bigger than normal.
This is actually my same 3rd pair that I bought. I love them so much that when it is all broken I buy a new one. I just love this sandals. Nice with anything you wear and it feels great on your back.
Love it.  Wore out the first pair that's why getting the 2nd pair.
I love this shoes , unfortunately they all come with memory foam , I'm not crazy about that.
At first I put them on and thought they were rubbing against my toes where the toe strap is between the toes. And push them aside. Then I put them on again and walked around for a while. They sort of stretched out a lil. And ended up not being the case. So I recommend walking around. You'll end up loving them. There a sandal. I bought 8 caz that's what I am. But I find that Sketchers run a lil small. But I did not want to have the heal hanging off the back of my foot. So in this case. The 8 was perfect.
My feet don't hurt anymore! Thanks!!!
I love these sandals, the memory foam insole is so comfortable, good arch support. I would buy other colors if they were available.
This shoe is super cute, lightweight, stylish AND comfortable. I haven't been able to wear heels due to back & leg pain. I was very happy to find the memory foam Cali shoes. I have several pairs & I am very happy with them all.
These shoes run small.  I usually wear 7.5, I ordered an 8 and it is still a tiny bit small.  I seem to have received a defective product as on one of the shoes, the memory foam insole is not properly sealed.  Overall, these shoes are quite comfortable but not for all day wear.<br /><br />Updated post:  I finally had time to update my post.  I received a replacement for the pair which the memory foam insole was not properly sealed.  After I had a chance to walk in these shoes for a few day, I must say these shoes are not comfortable at all.  The memory insole makes my feet unstable and I constantly had to adjust how my feet landed on the memory insole...very uncomfortable.  I would not recommend these shoes.
This is my second pair. They are just adorable and I liked them so much I have almost worn them out and wanted another pair.<br />Very comfortable. Have also ordered them in white.
These are my summer go to shoes. I had a pair before and actually wore them out. They are comfortable, have great arch support and look really cute. They fit true to size.
I'm a 6.5 and ordered these in a 7; they're too small.  I ADORE Skechers and these are super cute, but I don't understand why their sizing is so consistently inconsistent?  I have one of their shoes in a 6.5 and a another in a 7; both fit perfectly.  Am I also an 8 in this brand (a size I've never worn)?
The cushion made it really uncomfortable..........
I love Skechers sandals and running shoes.  That's all I wear all year long.
I can wear these super cute Skecher sandals all day long, and they are so much more fashionable than many other comfort sandals.  Love the added height they provide; and especially love the height doesn't create discomfort.  These sandals ROCK!
These shoes are so comfortable! Feels like I'm walk in my slippers. They are dressy enough to wear to work or going out casually! Love them!
These are some of the most comfy shoes I own.  Love them!
I bought this in the store and they run a whole size small. I normally wear size 8 and had to get 9. Overall pretty comfortable.
Love these shoes! -Extremely comfortable and cute.
Very nice shoes.  Comfortable for walking and colors go with many articles of clothing.
I expected these to be much more comfortable since they are Skechers.  The right shoe is much wider than the left, but not so much that I can't wear them.  I wear a wide width as it is and these seem a little too wide to wear all day even for me.  There is arch support and I think if the shoe fit better it would've provided better arch support.  They are really cute with jeans, though! :)
I really like these shoes-I thought when I first opened they were too small. But after I tried them on-loved the comfort/support.<br />I would really like to get another pair.  I think they might be the most comfortable shoes I've had. I appreciate the fact that Bealls sent me email making sure everything to my satisfaction.  I may get another color but I'm very happy with these Skeechers-wish all my shoes fit like these!  These are multi color so can go with lots of stuff!!<br />Thanks<br />mw
Love them !
Very Comfortable shoes, I highly recommend !
These shoes are super comfortable and hold my feet well. I love the Sketchers line.
My sister, who has a very high arch, fell in love with them.  Gave them to her.  She loves them.
Love these! Wedge is perfect height and extremely comfortable.
I got a black pair of skechers last year and loved them, so when I saw these with the multi color, I just had to order them. They go with so many outfits. LOVE THEM. I have a bad back so shoes can be a problem for me, but not these. Very comfortable and worth every penny!
super light and comfortable, great for travel
Love these shoes!  Very comfortable and fit me like I want them to fit.  Some wedges don't fit me too well because of the arch, but these fit very well.  Can wear them with most any colors I choose.
They are very comfortable with the memory foam sole.  Multicolor goes with different outfits
Love these shoes. Very comfortable and they go with everything.
These are GREAT SHOES! I love not having to break them in slowly and being able to wear them anywhere ALL DAY!
Cute but hard and tight. I returned it. Even the wide was tight and uncomfortable. I was very disappointed and would not recommend it for anyone with any mildly problematic feet.
I hope they have more color of the same shoes
My friend and I went on an impromptu two-hour walk, and I was wearing these shoes. No pain anywhere, no rubbing, just happy feet. And they go with everything!
I love them!
Much nicer in person than in photo.<br />Really like
Great
perfect
Extremely comfortable pair of sandals and the colors go with a wide range of outfits.
Very comfortable- nice shoe for work
I really loved my leather skechers wedge shoes and wore them all day until they wore out.  So I was a little disappointed in these.  They aren't as comfortable, don't fit as well and don't breath.  I wish the company would bring back the ones I loved.
I first got these shoes and one was a size 5 and the other a size 6. I usually wear a size 5 or 5.5 but Skechers run small. I sent back the order and received my shoes both size 6. I have worn them one day but they were comfortable.
Love these shoes
Straps too loose.  I have to curl my toes to keep on properly.  Had to return
very small but unfortunately I had worn them to work so didn't feel I could return them. I've bought other Skechers sandals that fit great!!
Love these!!! Where them everywhere. Work,.store and even at home. So comfy.
I have wide (&#34;fat&#34;) feet, so these did rub my toes at first. As I wore them, they became more comfortable. I could probably job a mile in them!
Perfect and very comfortable.
Cute and comfy.
These have become my go to shoes in the summer. Nice look and very comfortable
I returned these. They were nice looking but were loose around the straps.
These shoes are great. But the straps are a bit loose. I've got a wide foot, and even then they're loose.<br />Still, I like them, because I can stand in them for long periods without my feet killing me.
liked them
My 2nd pair of this shoe.  I owned the black last year and this year decided to order white.  They are so comfortable and feel great of my feet that have arch support issues.
I love them.... have a pair in every color!
I have other Rumblers and these are my favorite for summer. Comfortable, dress up or down. I am a 9M snd the length and with are exact.
Love Skechers!
These are fine if you have wide feet but I have average width and my feet go right through them. Had to return.
I now have 4 different pair / colors of these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. Lightweight and pretty.
I had a pair of the same style and the same size - just a different color. Ordered a new one pair as a replacement. Well: for some reason the sandals are way too wide at this time ! They don't hold your feet comfortable, so loose and wiggly! Had to give them away to Goodwill as an almost brand new pair - couldn't use those at all
Love these shoes. bought a pair in silver at the store and loved them, so when i saw them on amazon at a much lower price and in a different color, i had to have them.  they are truly wear all day sandals!
I prefer the memory foam soled styles that sketcher puts out but since those didn't come in white, I chose these and I like them but still wish the others came in white.
I liked the look of the shoes but my normal size 8 was way too huge in this shoe.
What a grateful sandal. Just as advertised
Good. Little too big, they slide off easily.  I'd order a size, or half size down from what you normally wear.
Love these sandals. They are the most comfortable shoes I have.
Once you have the shoes on, some straps are very loose, while others are tight.
I love the black Rumhlers with rhinestones !  They fit great. However, I have wanted to comment on the memory foam.  Seems like a comfortable concept, but my foot slips in them!  I wish you would go back to the rubber part on that part of the shoe.  They were much more comfortable without the foam.  Don't like foot slipping.  Otherwise great!
Nice sandal !  They are kind of dressy and are Very Comfortable!
Great, beautiful and very comfortable shoes! Just be sure to order one size up. They run small.
I have bunions and low arches, so it's difficult to find a pair of shoes that fits comfortably, but these ones do.  In fact, they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned; they provide excellent arch support and they look good, too!  I will definitely purchase these again.
Very comfortable shoes!
So comfortable and blingy.
Love the shoe but I have a very narrow foot so am going to try them with a liner in them
I love these skechers! The front are a bit wide but that doesn't hinder walking or comfort. They are nice enough to wear to church or an elegant dinner.
These shoes were a gift for a friend.  They are really cute.  I am giving them 4 stars because my friend who I purchased them for says they are a little snug.  I have wide feet and I have had to stretch them for her so they fit her and they are quite snug on my foot. These shoes are not good if you have wide feet. Other than that, they are great shoes and they are very comfortable.
Love the Go Walk shoes, comfortable & cute. Had a similar pair in black that wanted to replace that I loved. These are perfect and a bit dresser wth the stones on top.
Very very comfy, these tend to slide off your foot some , but so soft and comfyðŸ‘
When I received this shoe I could tell something was wrong before I even pulled them out of the box.  I still believe there might have been an error in shipping but I ordered two pair and they had the same issue.  They could easily have been 2 sizes too small.  I have other Skechers in other styles and I have never experienced this before.  I was truly disappointed because they are so cute and had the cushioning I wanted.  However, I am a size 11 and there was nothing more that I could do except return them.  :-(
Love them!  Bought these recently from a store.  I have wide feet, it's hard to find cute or pretty shoes (especially heels) that will feel comfortable, look good and fit right.  My heels are average but the front half of my feet are wide.  The neoprene stretches very comfortablely to my feet while not making my feet look &#34;fat&#34; due to my wide foot width.  I've also had ankle surgery and have a hard time wearing heels that won't cause pain.  The memory foam heels are amazing!  I can wear these all day and my feet feel wonderful.  I have such a hard time finding shoes for myself.  I'm so glad I got these!  You'll love them!<br />I do wish though that Skechers would make these in white, they'd be wonderful to wear with a wedding gown!  They are dressy enough with the rhinestones to work for that.
These shoes are so comfortable and cute. I wore them for hours walking and dancing and no pain no blisters.
Need to buy a 1/2 size bigger.
I love skechers shoes.  So comfortable!
beautiful shoe i wish you had more choices in shoes you can wear going out, i have total knee replacement on both knees and is hard for me to find comfortable shoes with the support that i need this type of shoe is perfect.
I love it
Comfortable and nice
I love these shoes!  I am on my feet all day and have had several foot surgeries and these shoes are so comfortable!
Love these.  Am ordering a back up pair.  You will not be disappointed!
Shoes are stylish and very comfortable. If your looking for a comfortable,stylish wedge these cali skechers are for you.
Very light weight, dressy looking..
I just loved these sandals. I do feel that Skechers USA needs to work on how long they will last. My pair & I bought another pair with memory foam.<br />both lasted from the end of April to July. Since I wrote to the company for assistance they sent me to the Skechers unit where I am presently living overseas. So the story goes..... they can't help I need to go back to USA.  I just wish the shoes were made better and I had some real feedback and help from the company for tthe price you pay for the sandals.<br />So otherwise a great fit and I really liked them for the 3 months.
Look great and are really comfortable.
Love these shoes.  I got a size 9 instead of 8.5 per other comments posted.  I have wide feet and have trouble finding sandals that don't give me blisters.  It is like wearing flip flops all day.  Update:  9 months later and still love these.  I wear them everywhere.  Would like some similar shoes without the cushion.
Cute & comfortable. Like walking on pillows
These are sooo comfortable!  And really nice looking sandals.Will dress up or dress down, too!
This is my second pair and I love them.
Simply love these sketchers,  light weight bottom and nice soft support to walking.<br />Enjoying my purchase
Bought this pair to replace the pair I have worn out.  Love how they fit. Super comfortable, even walking all day. Have a pair in brown also.  I wear one or the other to work everyday until it snows!
I love Skechers but don't like lack of half size. I wear an 8 in the GoWalks but ordered a 9 based on reviews. An 8.5 would have been prefect.<br />These are cute and flattering. It's hard to find a sandal that is cut lower down to flatter the leg, more important in black.<br />I am not crazy about anything between my toes and generally avoid thong or toe ring styles.<br />I had some black adhesive ball-of-foot cushons I hoped would 1) pad the ball of foot for more comfort because this shoe has very little compared to most Skechers and 2) it would push my foot back for a better fit.<br />The pads really don't do much-might look for another pair and stack them, especially as the straps are stretching.<br />I do not think these are that comfortable. They are super lightweight but have very little padding in front.<br />My feet and legs hurt after 2-3 hrs of walking/shopping.<br />I do not wear heels.<br />I kept these because I needed this style, they are very flattering, are a reasonable wedge height, they don't make any noise like flipflops, they were a Lightning deal and they are lightweight.<br />I would not buy another pair of these.
Best Sandals ever!!!!  So comfortable, foot flattering and flexible.
I have bought 5 pairs of these so far in past couple of yrs.<br /> My all summer- long shoes, very comfy.<br />I hope Skechers keeps making these.<br />I did find the memory foam- lined ones are slippery, so I am staying w/ the original ones.
I don't ever take the time to submit reviews but I have been looking for a long time for a comfortable cute sandal that I can wear for long periods of time and these are great!
Love them super comfortable with a small heel ! Great if you dont want a totally flat sandal.
Definitely a casual shoe. Dresses up the outfits I didn't want to wear flats with, but overall, I would have bought a &#34;real shoe&#34; with leather straps.
Super Comfortable, Sketchers does it again!  These sandals are so comfortable, with enough arch support to allow you to wear them the entire day.  The straps are a bit stretchy which makes them stay on your foot comfortably, but also work over my high arch.  The big toe strap is comfortably placed and does not rub.  The heel is not too high, but nice enough to work with summer dress pants.  When I ordered them it appeared that the straps were almost a 'velvet' but in reality they are an elastic of some sort, but they have the look of velvet - a very dark true black.  Overall these Sketchers are super comfortable, and dressy enough to work for other than those casual occasions.  Sketchers seems to have figured out the combination of fit, fashion and comfort when it comes to shoes and I am a fan of their footwear.
Size is small but I loverall them!
I am surprised how little I like these shoes. I have a friend who has tiny feet and they look great on her, plus she raves about how comfortable these are.<br />So, after reading nothing but great reviews, I bought them. I wear a size 10 and have slightly wide feet, The toe ring part is slightly too far back, (so they never feel like I have them completely on) and they do run somewhat narrow, IMO. Not much stretch either. They do FlipFlop when I walk. Won't return, but won't buy again.
I like these because they are light and fit well. It doesn't hurt my feet and they are true to size. Only issue is once you open the box it has strong odor- like glue or rubber. Not pleasant. It goes away wearing it.
I really love these shoes! I am a teacher and it is difficult to fund comfortable, nice shoes. They are so light and comfy and add a little height so they look nice and I can wear them for work.
I love it! This is my third one. It fit me very well.
Great shoe.  Light as air.  Order the size larger than you normally wear.
Amazing comfortable shoes. With a little dress
Very comfortable. As a teacher, I need something that I can wear all day, and these fit the bill!
love them  had a pair from 3 or 4 years ago and loved them.  was really happy that I found they were still making them!
Love sketchers. They always fit great!
I like them  just too small  so oredered bigger size  I usually wear a nine  needed a ten  all ok now
Great shoes. I have worn them every day
Important stuff first: runs true to size, comfortable to walk in and for extended wear, stays on your foot well, really cute<br />Long version: I love these wedges! When I first put them on, they were a little tight feeling by my toes and I had some doubts. After about fifteen minutes or wear they stretched enough for my toes to be comfortable and then didn't stretch any more. I've worn them to work, but don't recommend it in a quiet office as you'll have flip flop noises all day. I usually wear a nine and the nine I ordered fits perfectly without a bunch of extra sole at the front of back. Definitely recommend as a cute, comfortable summer wedge!
LOVE THESE SHOES!!!! Skecher out did themselves with these babies. It's like wearing sneakers! So comfortable and I have a hard time wearing any kind of heal, but I can wear these...Love them!!
So comfortable
Love finding a comfortable sandal and this is definitely it.  Love how it looks and happy that I ordered it!
Cute and comfortable!
Simple but cute, and more comfortable than I expected with the wedge style.
I LOVE these shoes. I am waiting for more colors to come out! Thumbs up .
Cute comfy shoes -- but they do run a little small. I generally wear a Skechers 9 or 9-1/2 -- the size 10 in this sandal barely fits... a 10-1/2 would be better. If you have high arches beware -- there is ZERO arch support. The sole itself is very foot friendly, just like walking on yoga mats. The straps keep your foot on the shoe, but are not so tight that they are uncomfortable. Something I really like about the shoe is that it does stay on your foot instead of &#34;flapping&#34; like so many backless sandals do; I can wear long pants without the hem of the pants getting caught between my heel and the heel of the sandal. Overall I would order these again, but with my high arches I wouldn't wear them on any walking expeditions.
had no idea just how heavenly these would feel!!!!  now more colors and some bling  hehehehe
I bought these when they came on sale, mostly on the strength of the extremely positive reviews.  I wish I'd seen them in person first.  One reviewer said they had great arch support.  You can tell from the picture there is zero arch support.  One review said they didn't flop when you walk, which sounded far too good to be true for a flip flop and most certainly was.  These flop with the best of them.  Several people said they could walk around in these all day with complete comfort, and I don't agree with that either.<br /><br />Maybe if you're used to $2 Old Navy flip flops you'd like these.  They'd be a step up from those, for sure, but overall these particular Skechers struck me as a cheap plastic shoe like the kind you buy at Payless (where I used to work.)  One reviewer said she could &#34;dress them up&#34; by wearing something other than shorts, and I don't agree that they look dressy enough to wear to, say, dinner.  They had a strong off-gas smell when I opened the box, and there is nothing to absorb sweat in the bottom.  Great if you wear them to the pool,  but if you're wearing them to walk around on a hot day (like summer) you'll be slipping and sliding if you sweat even the tiniest bit.  Gross.  Just a cheap shoe, out of many cheap summer shoes you could buy and probably already have a pair or two, like we all do.  Just don't pay full price.<br /><br />By the way, I normally wear a 7 to 7.5 in sandals, but I bought an 8 based on what some reviewers suggested and that was the right size for me so the reviews were right on the money there.  Also, as many reviewers said, the straps thankfully aren't a hard plastic like you see in even cheaper sandals.  They don't cut into your toes and feet.  That's not enough for me to keep these, though.
Very happy with these shoes!
I began suffering from progressively worse chronic lower back and hip pains over the last six months. I was taking a Aleve in the morning and another at night and still I had the pain. I received these in the afternoon, put them on for a few hours, and the next morning no backache. It was the only change from any other day. This is my fourth day and still no backache. The ache was pretty high on the pain scale so on the first morning after receiving them, immediately upon waking and sitting up in the bed, I went &#34;oh wow!&#34;. Even though I nearly always wear flats, there must be something in the way my weight is being distributed as I age and this must balance it back out by taking the stress off the back of the foot.<br />Oh and they are darn cute shoes too! I can wear these with shorts, summer dresses, and probably even get away wearing them with long skirts for work.
OMG! these are my second pair of these amazing, comfortable and cute shoes!  I could walk a day at Disneyland and not have sore feet and look cute in these! they are so comfortable and I highly recommend them!
Love the fit, very comfortable for work and play
COMFORTABLE BUT too much black !
This are my favorite sandals. I have planters fasciitis and they give me the perfect arch support. I can wear them all day and my feet don't hurt.  I have owned about 4 pair and just ordered another pair for this summer. However I recommend NOT to buy the ones with memory foam...they do not form to your foot as well after breaking them in and they cause your foot to slide around.
Second pair.  Love these shoes. Very comfortable to wear all day.
Love the sandals! Fast shipping! Excellent seller! A+++++
This is my second pair of these shoes. I bought the extra pair because the others were starting to wear out after much use. Dress up or down, very comfortable, lightweight, soft straps. They are great for travel, as well. I take them to the pool and wear them to work. I absolutely love these shoes.
Wear them for work, while out, even wore them walking in a parade. These are so comfortable and sturdy. Considering another pair.
Very confortable
Comfy casual sandal
This is my second pair of Rumblers. This model is much better than the newer one with the memory foam - which makes my foot slip.<br />I almost didn't buy my first pair because I'm usually not comfortable in shoes with the 'toe thong'. This shoe feels completely different than any other shoe I have tried with this style. I can, and do, wear it all day and can walk around all day in comfort.
I love these. Straps are very comfortable, cushioned and forgiving without being floppy - no flop in this flip! The straps hug the foot and feel secure,  providing real support in a flip-flop! Who'da thought? Would buy again and again.

So comfy! I have them on now!
One strap was much looser than the other,  but the sandal is still comfortable and light.
great shoes for all day wear
These are even better than expected! Perfect dressed up or casual!! Very lightweight & comfortable! Love these!
I've had my pair for over 7 years and they are my go-to shoes for traveling and errands about town. They are super lightweight and comfy while being semi-dressy as well. I've worn them with capris, sundresses and skirts. They've been everywhere with me, whether that be Hawaii or New Orleans or New York City. I believe they've been discontinued as the new models have memory foam in them. I've tried the rumblers with memory foam and find that the bulge of foam on the instep of each foot is very uncomfortable for me! I know there are many who love memory foam but I'd recommend trying the rumblers with memory foam on first if you are interested in those. The memory foam also results in a tighter fit, and you may have to size up. Me? I'm going to stock up on these, the ones without the memory foam, before it's too late!
My wife and daughter love these shoes.  They are very comfortable and the straps are neoprene (very soft and stretchy).  By far my wife and daughter's favorite set of footwear.
LOVE these shoes. Perfect for all day at the amusement park or even wearing into the ocean. And they're cute! I wear them so much I bought a second pair.
Comfortable and stylish. Basically what I hope to find in any shoe.
Fit great and very comfortable
Thought they stopped making these. My third pair in 7 years. I love these flip flops
Really comfortable
Love these shoes!! So comfy and can be casual or dressy.
Very comfy and cute!
Very comfortable shoes right out of the box.
Skechers Women's Rumblers have became my favorite pair of shoes.  They are super light weight.  They wear really well also.  I can really wear these all day long they are so comfortable.
Love the sandals !! I thought maybe the straps would be an issue especially since there is one that wraps the big toe. But these sandals are comfortable like everyone before me has stated. I am happy about my purchase and will be buying different colors as well !!
These are cute and were rather comfy and stylish especially for something on the more casual side. But I found the insoles to be a bit hard, they lacked the memory foam padding that is present in the Young At Heart model in the same line (Skechers Rumblers). I ordered both and kept the young at heart AND then bought them for my mom who also loves them. So I recommend those over this model.<br /><br />As with other Skechers sandals, I found these to fit 1/2 size too large. I usually wear size 8.5 in sandals and 9 in boots and the size 9 of these fit me perfectly. So if you are in between sizes order one size up.
Fit perfect. They're super light. I wore them to Disneyland all day a few times and they were perfect.
I wear these everyday! They are so comfortable.
I ordered a size 7 first and they were too narrow, the length was perfect. I had to return them and get the 8, so the width fits with the 8's but they're a tad too long, but I can live with that.  They're very comfortable.
These Skechers Women's Rumblers-Beautiful People Flip... are great ..my second pair!
These shoes are very comfy for a wedge, with a sporty feel that is to be expected from Skechers. I've gotten several compliments on them!
Perfect fitting shoe. Good price.
I wear a size 6 and these shoes were very small. Not comfortable because of that.
Love these
Love these. Sooo comfortable. I didn't wear many heels or wedges until now.
Ooooh so comfy and nice to wear with a summer dress, jeans or shorts. I love these. I love sketchers anyway. I don't normally wear any kind of heal because my feet hurt in heals but these are really great.
I expected the in soles to be softer, more gel-like.  It is a bit hard for me and that is why I didn't give it a higher rating.  I am not sorry with the purchase.  They are cute and I like the height of the heels and they are quite comfy enough.
love them ...my third pair in the last 5 years
I found them a good fit and very comfotable
Very comfortable shoes. I purchased a half size under my usual shoe size and was thrilled that the fit was ideal. Whereas, I am usually in excruciating pain any time I try to walk even short distances, in any type of foot wear with the exception of absolute flats with arch support, I was, able to walk in these attractive low wedge shoes for hours with no discomfort while<br /> on my carib.vacation. Good buy.
I love these!!!
These are my favorite sandals.  I buy a couple of pairs every year bc these shoes are comfy, water proof and go with all kinds of outfits.
Cute and comfortable
I love these flip flops!  I live in flip flops year round; even in the snow!  But I don't like flats because then my pants drag on the ground.  I had a pair of these in silver that my mom picked up on clearance a couple of years ago.  I have worn them out because I literally wear them every day in all weather.  I went online to replace them and these are exactly the same except for the color.  They are so comfortable, go with everything, and hold up well.  Worth every penny!  I also get compliments on them.
These sandals are very cute and fit true to size.
I thought I liked these at first due to the light weight feel and cushy sole.  I bought 3 pairs. The problem is that the arch is in the wrong spot.  It broke my foot by placing weight in the wrong spot.  I didn't learn from the first fracture, wore them a second summer and endured another fracture.  Needless to say, these were thrown away.  Even though these didn't work, I still LOVE Sketcher's &#34;go walk&#34; shoes!
I love these shoes!!!
I love these shoes. I find they fit great, they are comfortable and look great. I buy the same shoe every year, as they are so nice.
I wore these sandals to the shore last weekend and they were like wearing flip flops. Soooo comfortable. We walked many hours up and down the boardwalk and through the outlet stores. Never once did my feet hurt. I highly recommend them as I do for all sketcher products.
My favorite sandals!
I bought these in another color last year and I find that these fit just a bit smaller. However, they are still comfortable. I had them on all day and had no problem.
I like them!
The strap between the toe is a bit thick which might take some getting used to.  Overall, I like them.
Love these shoes!  I buy a new pair every year because I wear them everyday all summer long to work.  I bought a pair of the new ones that have memory foam and I dislike them, hopefully they won't stop making these ones without the memory foam.
Only worn them for a little while, but they sure seem great. I'm typically an 8 wide, and these fit fine. As another reviewer noted, I was also a little hesitant because I don't like the toe ring. But, so far, I have no issues with it. I have high hopes that I'll be wearing them a lot.
I absolutely love these shoes!! They are adorable and so comfortable!
Amazingly comfortable!!  Omg this is a must buy!  You will fall in love with the way they feel on your feet.
Love Love Love these shoes,I will order more!!!
Favorite casual shoes for everydayðŸ‘
Very Comfortable
This is my second pair of these. So comfortable and versatile. Can be worn with jeans or a dress. Love them!
I have been ordering these for a third year in a row and am really happy i have found them. Soft and comfortable, perfect for my sensitive feet.
Shoes were great.  Just what I expected.  Very happy I bought them.
I love these shoes and I wear them a lot during the summer to work. I have them in silver, brown, black and the silver black. I have bought a few pairs of the same colors over the years because they only last a summer or two with daily wear but they are great while they last. I have wider feet and these fit perfectly and I can wear them for hours without any issues.
I absolutely love love love these shoe s!!! I can wear them all day long and my feet don't hurt!! SO COMFORTABLE!!!! I'd buy them in all the colors theycame in if they were available!
best shoes for my feet
I have bought these several times and still love them.
My third pair. I have trouble finding shoes that fit me right (wide toes, short and stubby feet), but I basically live in these all summer and fall. This will be my third year with them... they do eventually wear out (the rubber/foam on the bottom wore down on one side of the shoe more than the other, so I was walking crooked for a month without figuring out why!), but I got plenty of use out of each pair. Love them so much that I had the newest pair shipped to me on vacation so I wouldn't have to rely on finding a good pair of sandals there. I'd forgotten that you have to break them in a bit, though! The straps can be stiff at first (at least if you have fat toes like me!). Took a couple of days before I could slip them on and off comfortably again.
I was very leery of ordering shoes but I gave it a try anyways these shoes fit so good they are the most comfortable shoes in different colors I will buy more
Great shoes but alittle small!
Love these shoes.
My first pair fitted snugly for about four years and became too loose, This is my second pair and unfortunately the straps that hold the foot in are loose, any ideas on how to tightn them up.
Secrets are comfy and cute and last forever!!
normally im hard to fit for a shoe,i read all the reviews and took a chance and im so glad i did they are so comfortable,i would recommend theses shoes.i take an 8 but ordered a 9 so go up a size.
My wife loves these...hope to find more in other colors as well...
Perfect comfortable casual shoe with just a bit of spice to make them better than a flip flop.
These are the best sandals EVER.  I have a high arch and these give great support throughout the day.  I buy a new pair every year.  They seem to be getting more difficult to find in stores like I used to so I am so glad I can get them on line.  I have about 6 pair from previous years that I still wear. they are super soft and NEVER rub your skin and there is no need to &#34;break them in&#34;.  If I could I would wear them to work but unfortunately they are not within our dress code standards.  They are the first thing I change into when I get home.  Having the toe slot keeps your foot from sliding off like regular flip flops do.
My favorite sandals!
Very comfy, and I've had many compliments on them!
They look cute.  I  love these.  I have very high arches and have trouble finding comfortable shoes.  These feel good when I put them on and I wore them all day at WDW with complete comfort.  More colors please!
Confortable.
Excellent shoes very comfortable!
I have joint problems, wide feet, and it is always difficult for me to find comfortable shoes. These Skechers sandals are amazing! They are super comfortable, I can wear them all day long without any pain. Plus they look really nice. They exceeded my expectations!
I was disappointed as I usually like Skechers. These were much smaller than expected and I knew they weren't going to work out, so I returned them and purchased a similar model of the Bernie Mev shoe.
Really like them and they are very comfortable.
I love them, they are so comfortable
LOVE MY SKETCHERS!!!!!
Very pretty but sandals seem to run wide.  Had to put Intersole in shoe which helps somewhat.
I have these in Black and they're amazingly comfortable and very attractive on the foot!  I'm getting another pair!
These are the best shoes.  I bought this style before and they are the most lightweight and comfortable shoe you can wear.  I have problems with my feet and I do very well in these shoes. I went to a wedding and danced in these shoes with no problem and my feet felt great..  Stayed on my feet just fine. I have 4 pairs and am extremely happy.  Highly recommend.
So comfortable.....
Always perfect fit with Skecher's - very pleased.
I hope they soon have more colors. Love them.
Totally Awesome!
very comfortable.  I work on a concrete floor and I can wear these shoes most of the day.
The sandals are comfortable and look lovely.  They were delivered on time , great product. They were a bit larger on my feet than expected, I have another style of the rumblers that run smaller.
just wish they made them wider, it is hard to get my foot in. I would of returned them but my husband throw the box away., now im stuck with shoes that dont really fit
When I received this shoe I could tell something was wrong before I even pulled them out of the box.  I still believe there might have been an error in shipping but I ordered two pair and they had the same issue.  They could easily have been 2 sizes too small.  I have other Skechers in other styles and I have never experienced this before.  I was truly disappointed because they are so cute and had the cushioning I wanted.  However, I am a size 11 and there was nothing more that I could do except return them.  :-(
Shoe size correct for this brand. Sandal straps do not fit as they are too high and very loose. Had to return.
loved the shoe...wish it came in wide....
so comfortable, lots of cushion and the straps aren't uncomfortable
Little shorter than other in the same size&#34;
This is the most comfortable shoe EVER!! Unbelievable.
Love these! So comfortable.
Great looking and fitting sandal! Wore these comfortably for hours at the airport and destination. Very happy with these and thinking of getting a spare pair.
They are very light - which is a big PLUS for me.  I am not as steady on my feet as I used to be - and have even had sandals fly off my feet because they were heavy. I miss my high wedges,  but these are not a bad substitute.
Extremely comfortable and cute!  Love them!!
I have Plantar Fasciitis so you need a good arch , which this shoe has. I also have Periferal Neurapathy and I need cushioned foot bed...which this shoe has. VERY PLEASED!!! I even ordered a pair in black.
Just what I was looking for!  The yoga mat bottom is so comfy.  The straps are just tight enough to keep the shoe on my foot without any pain.  They go with everything!
Nice shoes!
Will definitely buy this over and over again when needed.
Very cute but had to send back because they are too narrow
LOVE THEM!! I get some many people stop me to stay how they love these shoes. They are so comfortable I wear them all the time walking around!
This wedge sandal is super comfortable. If you're looking for something that you can wear all day by these
I had purchased these in the black color from the local mall and absolutely love them...so decided to order them in white as well.  Unfortunately, the white ones don't seem to be of the same quality??  The right shoe lost half the silver studs off it on the first day I wore them.  They don't feel as padded as the black ones either?  I thought it was me but had my daughter try them on and she noticed the difference as well.  If I had purchased these first I would not have ordered them in another color.  (But wear my black ones 2-3 days a week with no stud loss or visible wear)
Comfortable shoes
Cute and comfy!  Love the memory foam by Skechers!  And really love to see it in shoes besides their tennis shoes.
I love Sketchers. They are pretty much all I wear. And now I have a pair to get dressed up with and they are totally comfortable
Love these shoes
Great product
Lightweight and really comfortable. I never wear heels, but these are so comfortable with the memory foam, you don't feel like your wearing a wedge heel . love them.
Good support for all day wear at work.
Great shoe, Thanks.
These are most likely my least favorite pair of skechers. I am use being able to wear this brand for hours and not have any issues. But with these after about 3 hours my feet are tired. They are snug around the toes and they dont' seem to give much
Nice shoe.  Very comfy.
fantastic
Very comfortable!
Shoes are to wide, unable to keep on my feet.will be sending back . Arrived timely.
Love these sandals!
one of the rivets was missing and they are very narrow
Exceeded expectations plus the cushion is very comfortable
Skechers - what is there to say - love them!
I bought the black ones and really like them, so I went ahead and got the white ones.  Big difference.  The size is the same but the upper material is different and the studs fell off the first day I wore them :-(((.
I bought them specifically because of the arch support and I am very happy with them.  I can wear them for long periods, although my feet tend to sweat and the footbed starts to warm up so I have to take them off to cool my feet.
LOVE THIS PAIR-SO COMFORTABLE
Love these shoes!  I was afraid the arch of these wedges wouldn't fit just right for my size 6 feet, but these do.  They are very comfortable and I enjoy wearing them.
Smallest size 10 I've ever seen! I usually take a 9-9.5, but these looked a little small, so got the 10...forget it! Can just about get my right foot in and the left not at all! Sending back.
These sandals are so comfortable I wore them to work and went for a walk in them on the same day without any issues.  Im thinking about buying another pair.
These are just about the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn besides a tennis shoe.  The heel is just the right height and the padded sole is the bomb!
I gave these Sketchers two stars because of the quality and fit. I should have sent them back! Very cute style but that's about it. Wore them twice no support, very squishey and do not hold their shape. I have several sketcher sandals and these just do not measure up. I won't buy on line again!
Excellent shoe, very comfortable, can be dressed up or great with jeans. Awesome with a fresh pedi!
Love these shoes
Bought these because my flip flops were giving me blisters as I was walking around Vegas. So stopped in at the sketchers store and not only are these gorgeous, they allowed me to keep walking another 5 hrs instead of going to my hotel to rest my feet! LOVE them
Love the memory foam insole and sparkles
I hope they have more color of the same shoes
They r very good. Like them very much
THESE ARE MY FOURTH PAIR OF THESE. I ALSO HAVE THEM IN BLACK, WHITE, AND STRIPED. I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND THIS BRAND OF SHOE THAT FITS MY WEIRD FEET. I HAVE HAD TO FIND AND BUY HELLE'S UNTIL I FOUND THESE! I LOVE THEM.
I love these shoes!  They are pretty and extremely comfortable! I have them in two colors!
Very comfortable!  Highly recommended
This shoe is very comfortable, but casual.
These sandals looked cute and had gel cushion, but it was too wide and didn't feel comfortable walking with them.
I have two pairs of these and they are perfect for my Florida lifestyle!  I wear them with capris, ankle length pants and skirts and they look good with all of them!
They can make feet sweat.  Solution was to buy a separate deodorant stick and put that on my feet and that prevents your feet from sweating in the rubber shoes and allows them to be worn comfortably for many hours and preventing you posters
Cute shoes.  The description said the embellishment was rhinestones but they are actually silver studs.  A little disappointing when you're shooting for BLING but they are cute and catch light well.  Really cute so not a total disappointment.
Very comfy
So cute & comfortable.
pretty as the picture.. great soul, little tight on my wide foot.
I returned mine.  They felt &#34;weird.&#34;  I happened to see them at a store later and tried them on to see if my original pair were defective or if that's just how this shoe fits.  It turns out that the shoes in the store fit fine and weren't &#34;weird.&#34;  I probably just got a lemon pair, but keep in mind that it's a possibility.
Comfy. I am looking forward to warm weather to wear.
These sandals are as beautiful as they are comfortable. They run true to size. Love them!
I didn't know that they ran kind of small I should had ordered a half size larger!!!!!l
Cute shoes, but I wear a 9 1/2 and the footbed was a little too big, causing my foot to slide around some.  This made my foot inch forward, making the top of the shoe to rub on my foot. I knew that this would be a problem so I had to send them back.
I love the shoes.  If my feet wouldn't slide forward and my toes wouldn't be passing over the shoe, I would definitely keep them!  They look great and they feel so good on the feet.  If you have a thicker foot, this would be a great sandal!  My feet are on the thinner side and they would slide right down, almost out of the sandal... not a good look!!  LOL!  I also really love the little silver studs.  These are not leather, but they look and feel nice (still a quality shoe as to be expected with sketcher).
I returned this product - I did not like the fabric of the upper.  They were comfortable - but not what I was looking for
cute, but very narrow for me.
Really cute shoe. I liked the black so much I went back and ordered the white
Super comfortable! Love them!
They are ok.  I could not wear them for a long time and they are a little wide on my feet.  They are cute to wear out to dinner.
I own th rumblers in eery color and style.
I really like these shoes, they fit well, look good and are very comfy
They are very comfortable but run a bit big around the top of the foot.
love them
I love them!
I will buy these shoes every year!  Even when brand new, I walked all over the hilly campus of Sam Houston State for 2 days and my feet were happier than when wearing my Asics!  I'm over 40, so good shoes are becoming a must. :)
Very cute sandals and very comfy for this 8 month preggo's feet.
I love Skechers! I wear these and others to work in all day and they are so comfortable!!
These are the  the most comfortable wedges I've ever owned. I'm a fashion stylist so I'm on my feet a lot. My feet aren't crying by the end of the day :)
Cute and can wear them all day.
Very comfortable.
Took a little getting used to the straps but overall the shoe is awesome and looks great!
a
I normally wear an 8 - 8 1/2 and I bought the size 8.  They fit just fine.  I didn't have any &#34;break in&#34; period either which is a plus.  They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day.  Hightly recommend.
The fit was smaller than expected
Actually great to walk around in.  So think of when you try shoes on in the store and walk around a little in them and think &#34;yeah, these feel really good&#34;.  And then you buy them.  That's what happened - got the shoes in the mail, tried them on and walked around a little and was so happy I got them.  Then I wore them all day... and by all day I really mean about 6 hours.  Didn't even walk around for all 6 hours.  And now they hurt me at the top right where the pretty lotus flower design is located.  They have become my &#34;less than 2 hour sandals&#34;.
These shoes was very pretty and extremely uncomfortable, especially the toe strap.  The toe strap was hard and the shoes is narrow in<br />size.  If you wear a size 8, I would suggest an 8 1/2. I returned them the same day.
love love love them
Cute shoe...great comfort!  For casual or slightly dressed up.
Perfect.....I NEED the comfy yet cute sandal with a little height. These are fantastic!
So comfortable!  This is my second pair.
Shoes are good, just wish they would have half sizes.  7 is too small and 8 is just a little too big.  I wear the 8 anyway.
I love these and can wear 24/7. Too bad they stopped making them. I like to doodle so, I customize the white patten leather pairs.
The size 9 was just slightly too short. They were fairly comfortable but looked a little too cheap or plastic-ey. Returned.
Because these shoes are so comfortable and because they fit so well, and because I usually wear them all summer, I but a new pair just about every three years or so.  Love them.
I love these shoes.  I had the white ones and they were so comfortable that I could wear them all day without any problem.
I love my sandals
I love this shoe so much; I try to buy as many as possible.  This shoe is extremely comfortable!
LOVE these shoes. They are my go to flip flops. Extremely comfortable!
I like these pretty shoes. They feel somewhat comfortable. I have not worn them for a long time yet, so I can't tell much yet. Will give an update when I do. One thing for sure, they are too long in the front for me and there's a lot left over at the end of my toes. Then again, everyone's feet are not shaped the same way.
Nice light weight sandal, just not what I expected from Skechers. I have been a huge fan for years and not ever been disappointed, I guess there is a first for everything. They are not what I consider Skechers quality. Good for the beach because they are plastic! Very disappointed.
I like these sandals, but do find them a little wide on one of my feet.  Otherwise very comfortable and stylish.  They an be worn dressier than other sketchers which is very nice.  I would have given them a 5 star except the fit is a little off, still I would recommend these to anyone.  Really like them.
Didn't like the way these looked or felt.
not happy with the material for the sole--not the same as the rubber as in similar models.  caused my foot to slide and blitered the bottom.  also, the way the straps angle your feet they force my heels off the back inside of of the shoe when I walk for more than a short distance.  I will get rid of these and go back to the regular rumblers.
Love these. We'll see how long they last. The last 2 pairs I had got a hole on the right shoe in an odd place (where the ball of my foot sits). I've never had shoes do that before.
I have had a pair of these all summer and LOVE them! So much that I ordered another pair for when the first pair wears out! The first pair has been amazing, comfortable, cute and holding up very well! Much to my disappointment though, the second pair was an entire half size smaller (even though the size for both pairs were listed as 9s) AND the black on the straps where it attaches to shoes was already coming off.
These are great sandals.  Very comfortable, you can wear them all day and they are a cute style.
Very comfortable and pretty.
Love this style
Most comfortable sandles ever!!
loose and poor fit, will be asking for a return
Great shoe and super comfortable.... I wear between a 7 and a 7.5. I ordered a 7 but should have got the 8.
Love them!  Bought 3 pair in different colors.
OMG!  The most comfortable shoes I own!  I had a pair that I bought last year and I love them, but I spilled permanent ink on them so I wanted to find another pair.  Ok, now to get a little personal.  I have all kinds of trouble with my feet, from tendinitis, to bunions, to rare deformities in the structure.  So finding comfortable shoes that I can wear all day is a challenge.  The pair I spilled ink on was the only pair I could wear comfortably all day long (I teach and I am on my feet all day).  This new pair is even better!  They added memory foam and it feels incredible!!!!!  I went back online and bought the gunmetal and I'm hoping they get the black pair and bronze in stock again in my size, because I'd buy every color if I could.  And the bonus is, they look cute too!!!  Women know how hard it is to find a comfortable AND cute shoe.  Finally, a feminine shoe that has comfort in mind.  I love them!
My only complaint is not all the leather straps are the right length. One seems a little short and one a little long,but I still like them and get compliments. VERY comfortable!
Item great arrived sooner than expected very pleased. With them. Thank you
I like the shoe but I have discovered that Sketchers run slight smaller than other shoes.  I usually need a 1/2 size larger.
The left shoe fit perfect!  the right shoe was stretched out.  It seemed these shoes were a display and everyone tried on the right shoe and stretched out!  Would of been FIVE stars if the right shoe fit like the left!
The shoes I received were not consistently made.  The left shoe is too large and flops when I wear it.  The right shoe is just right.  This is really interesting because my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot.  There is very little arch support which is a disappointment since Skechers is known for making comfortable shoes with good support.
The shoes are fashionable and comfortable. The fit is perfect. Love them!
Very comfortable. They're a little less dressy than I was going for, but I still love them.
They are like walking on pillows!  I love them!
little too big that the toes slide down too far
The old style (FKA Tangled Rumbler) with the rubber footbed is much better. The new ones with the memory foam are slippery. When I wear them my foot slides from side to side. I almost twisted my ankle. So disappointed that Sketchers changed the style. The memory foam is awesome in their shoes...super comfortable. But in their sandals...not at all. Sketchers, please change back to your old style!
These are the most comfortable shoes I own!  They are lightweight, and fashionable while providing comfort.  Because they have a wedge heel, they look dressy, without feeling dressy (uncomfortable).  Like walking on air!
I love love my Skechers Rumblers. I own 5 pairs, wouldn't leave home without them! Great on our boat as a non skid sandal!
The shoes look great and are nice and comfy for all day wear. My only complaint is that the straps on the left shoe is more loose than the right side, so my foot slides forward when I walk, which is a little annoying. The right shoe fits great. Now, you might be thinking that maybe my left foot is smaller than my right, but actually my left is slightly bigger than my right. So you would think it works out, but no. The left shoe straps are definitely way more loose.
love it
I ordered these because they looked comfortable. When I received them one shoe was much smaller than the other. I wasn't even able to get it on my foot. It must have been labeled incorrectly. Amazon was great about it. I sent them back and they replaced them with a perfect pair. Very comfortable!
Very comfy straight out of the box! Wore all day to work.  Straps have a subtle shimmer.
My feet slipped around it the shoes.  Although the length was perfect, and the width not too wide, my feet slipped with each step- back and forth.  My husband said&#34; Why are you walking so funny?&#34;  It was that my foot was moving back and forth with each step. Not a good shoe even when you're trying to look good!  Not a typical Skechers comfort fit either!
Love the sketchers.  I have bought these for the last two years and love them.  I wear them to work and they are dressy and even with my maxi dresses.  They are perfect for summer and light weight.
Almost too small. I'm 7 usually but could of used a 7 1/2 or 8. But they are super comfy, cute, and lightweight. I can work in them all day.
I have these in black,silver and bronze, the bronze fits a little more snugger ( I normally wear wide width so for you narrow people might be too wide) but I am need in comfortable shoes and don't want to wear flats and sneakers, I have a double heel spur in my dominant foot and I wear these all the time.
Very nice and comfy. A true sketchers shoe.
I really love this model and brand. I don't have to worry anymore to try to find a comfortable pair of shoes!! The only issue I want to bring here is the change of the sole. In the past it used to have a rubber sole (I'm talking about the sole where the foot fit) now it is synthetic which has the very big problem of absorbing the odor of the foot. The rubber sole never had bad odor... but this synthetic has.. even I tried to wash it and use food powder... it does not work. I would highly recommend to the manufacture that change the sole again.
comfortable to  wear all day.
I usually wear a wide shoe but these only came in medium and were fine,  very comfortable
These shoes are so comfortable!  I work in an office setting and have to dress in business attire.  These shoes are perfect for casual or dressy outfits.  I am on my feet a lot during the day, these shoes provide all day comfort.  The only thing I would have to complain about is the width is somewhat too big. The size runs about a 1/2 size smaller than my tennis shoes. Overall great product, I would order again!
Super comfortable and stylish too!
The straps are alittle roomy but the foam memory is ridiculously comfortable. Look great!!!
I followed the other reviews and ordered up to a size 9. My feet are 8 1/2 with a D width, and flat. I need good arch support, and this sandal has a good arch support.
I love these shoes. They're so comfortable, feels like I'm walking on air.
Very comfortable and really cute.
These shoes give great support and I can easily wear them all day with no pain or blisters. They look cute as well and have good traction.
Love them.  Wore them to a wedding.  Even danced in them, and they never hurt my feet or slipped off!
Just love Skechers, all their shoes. I went on a field trip with my daughers class and wore them all day. My feet were not sore and all the other moms wearing tennis shoes were complaining of their feet hurting. The only thing is I wish they came in half sizes instead of all whole sizes. Due to this is a slip on sandal, I could of used a 6 1/2(if they even offered half sizes) or maybe even a 6. Instead of buying the 7. There's nothing to stop from your foot moving all the way forward when you walk with this style.
Stellar comfort and cute, cute, cute!  Didn't know that they were memory foam until I got them and I couldn't be happier with them.
this is the 3rd pair I have bought and I freaking love them..... supper comfy, even for working 13 hrs days.
Perfect......wonderful....enough said, they're Sketcher Perfection!
Love these sandals!  They're cute and comfortable, and the bronze color goes with everything!
Love them!  Bought first pair in white and liked them so much I bought another color.  Comfort is awesome and they are so cute!!!
Super comfy but a little clunky.  Build for comfort, not for speed...  I just upped this to 5 stars after wearing them all day and my feet still feel fab.  Love the copper color, too.
Extremely comfortable. great sandals. Just love them!
I love the shoe and it wears very well and it's really comfortable.
Love these! So comfortable. Love the memory foam.
Skechers are always a comfortable and reliable shoe.  These shoes don't have a lot of glam but my feet definitely aren't aching after wearing them all day.
The straps are a little snug, and they don't seem to stretch all that much.  Other than that, the arch support and memory foam are comfortable.
very goodï¼Œbut Driving can not wear
Love them, unfortunately the dog ate one a few days after I got them, so need to buy another pair!
the most comfortable Skechers yet. they now have a cloth, cushioned insole. highly reccomend
skechers needs to work on their sizing a 6 is to big and the 5 barely is big enough.
The left shoe hurts.  I think that it is the strap.  The right shoe fits great and is comfortable.
Extremely satisfied with this product. They are super comfy and chic. Love them and definitely worth buying :)
The straps across the top are too loose.  I purchased two different sizes, but even the smaller pair was too loose.  I'm disappointed because I really like this shoe.
Have same size in white but this pair a lil small
love these shoes
These are really cute summer slip-ons! They are quite comfy with great arch support. The straps over the top of the foot are a little loose for my foot, but I can still walk comfortably in them.My husband likes them as well.
Love the shoes comfort!
I love Sketchers! I always know they're just right for my feet! Love the support! The shoes are light and you can wear them for hours!
Very comfortable!!
Love the fit and the color!
Absolutely love these shoes. Actually bought these after purchasing them already in white because they are so cute and comfortable!
Light as a feather and good cushion
Liked the shoes but they were too narrow
These shoes are adorable, but run small.  I normally wear a 5 1/2 or 6. I ordered a 6 as anything else is usually way too big.  These are way too small.  My toes would hang off the front edge if I walked in them and they were pretty tight.  So very cute, but just didn't work for me.
I love any Skechers sandals but these were a little big.  Only because they do not come in half sizes and I'm a 6.5.  Six is too small and 7 just a little big.
Disappointed in the material for the sole. I've purchased other Rumbler style Sketchers with rubber sole. The material used on this shoe made my foot slide in the shoe. Since my foot slide forward, it caused irritation from the rubbing.
For being wedge shoes, these are very comfortable and can wear them all day. I actually tried them on in the store first but chose to buy them from Amazon because they were a better price.
Ver comfortable, love these shoes.
Love these shoes! So comfortable!
This shoe has an arch support that relieves my nagging lower back pain.  It is so light and wonderful to wear. For others out there who can't wear the cute summer flats because of your high arches--this is the answer!  Perfectly casual, but still feminine.
The right shoe is much wider than the left shoe. ðŸ˜¥
cute as can be, but feel like they are so wide I might step out of them while walking. I know returning them will cost me $$ so am  going to try inserts, which should help arch support.
These are very comfortable and soft to my feet.
These were really cute, but they didn't fit my foot correctly.
I have trouble with wedges or heels being hard to walk in all day. These are so comfortable with the soft foam inside I can wear them all day at work and also walk around shopping and not have sore feet.
Awesone look and feel.
I had the version of these shoes without the memory foam and liked them much better.  The straps on top seem to be too tight.
The straps were way too loose so I had to send them back.<br />Sadly, I would have really liked them otherwise.
I'm a Sketchers fanatic for flip flops.  These are cushy on the bottom with the memory foam insole.  I love that they are a little dressy.  The strap on one foot on my big toe rubs a little bit...but not on the other foot (strange), but otherwise I love them.  Bought in black and brown/bronze.  Love the iridescent straps.
Lightweight, good arch support, ended up returning them, they were a little too wide around the top...
I really like the look of these shoes.  I have another pair of Sketchers from a few years ago and they too run a bit small.  Definitely order a size up.  I have not worn them for any length of time but the memory foam promises to be comfortable.
I really liked the look and feel of this sandal. Tried it on at the Skecher store and decided to buy this online since it was at a lower price. I think I would have liked this sandal, but unfortunately I received 2 different sizes. I wondered why one side was so loose and foot would slide forward so much and not the other side. Well, I got my ruler and measured it and found that one side was about a 1/4 of an inch wider and longer too. The label under the sandal said a size 7 but I think it should have been labeled 7W. Error on Skechers part? Anyway returned it and decided not to have a replacement for fear of another mistake. Too Bad, nice and comfortable sandal.
These shoes are cute, unbelievably comfortable, and close to perfect.  The only issue I have is that the straps across the top of the foot are very loose.  But that didn't stop me from buying another pair.  I can wear these all day long and they still feel like heaven at the end of the day.
At first I loved the shoes...but now, not so much. I decided to edit my review becase the memory foam sole didn't last very long.  I've only owned this pair for a couple of months and I've already worn a hole into the memory foam...right where the ball of my foot sits in the sandal.  I prefer Sketcher's original rubber soles. Those lasted forever!  SWITCH IT BACK SKETCHERS!
I like this brand ... I have 3 now ... It is very comfortable... and stay for longer time .... I love them so much
These are perfect. They fit around my foot. Very comfy. I am hoping to buy black and white too. Definitely a good buy.
I love the memory foam. I can wear them all day in confort
Love them.  I'm a bartender,  and can work all day wearing them.
I love them. Very comfortable.
These don't fit as well as the ones without the memory foam. The foam pushes your toes up into the straps and makes them too tight. Also, it feels less stable than the other kind of Rumblers that have no memory foam. I basically hate the foam!
They are very comfortable.  I need to get use to the memory foam, which really does cushion the feet.  I usually wear flat sandals, so am adjusting to the heel height, when I wear them, but it doesn't take very long to do so.
My favorite and most comfortable shoes ever!
Great comfort and style. Walk all day.  Order a size larger than you usually wear in Skechers.
I love the Skechers Rumblers shoes and have purchased several of their styles over the last couple of years.  Although this style now has the memory foam cushion, I find the fabric to be a bit slippery.  My foot slides forward a touch while walking.  I think I prefer the rubber foot pads better.  It is still comfortable, wears well, and looks nice with jeans, capris, skirts and shorts. Great shoe.
These do run small.  I ordered an 8 and I normally wear a 7-1/2.  My foot just barely fits in them.  They do have the memory foam padding, which is comfortable.  I also think the opening for your big toe is a little small also.  This does start bothering me after a while, but I am hopeful that they will stretch out a bit.
Comfortable, but a little tight around the toe area.
Its excellent
My favorite go too slip on summer sandal I loved them so much I ordered a second pair!!
Love them!!!! They're awsome! !!!
I really like the memory foam soles, but they are smaller then the previous pairs I've had so I'll be ordering a size larger from now on.
I needed these shoes on a half size and they don't make them.  Darn!
I agree with a previous poster....the memory foam is very slippery! I've had these shoes in black and gold, with the &#34;rubber&#34; insoles. After my puppy chewed the black pair, I purchased another. I have always considered these shoes a fantastic choice....comfortable, stylish and a nice height (I am not a fan of flats). In these, I feel as if I'm going to slide out of them, at any moment. I did not realize the difference, when I purchased them. I am very comfortable, walking in all types of shoes, including 4-5&#34; high-heels. These do not work for me.
Very comfy!
Love this style
These run small. I normally take a 6 1/2, 7, I got these in a 7, and they are too small. I have an older pair without the memory foam in a 7 and they fit perfect. Also, I almost twisted my ankle, the memory foam is really slippery. It's too bad, they were quite pricey and I really wanted to love them, but I don't. Won't be buying again.
These are very comfortable and fit me perfectly. I am a size 5 so it isn't easy to find shoes that fit well. I wouldn't say that these have excellent arch support but it is very good and the foot bed is so cushiony that it feels like I am wearing slippers. They are also lightweight, which is a bonus.
Love the &#34;memory foam&#34; in these.  Makes them very comfortable.  They do run a tad small.  I usually wear 8 1/2 and the 9 were snug
I bought these exact sandals in a silver last year in a size 8 and they were my favorite sandals.  The looked good with casual skirts and shorts.  They were amazingly comfortable.  They were wearing out so I ordered these to replace them, and they are 3/4 of an inch shorter in length.  I am really bummed as I was very excited for a replacement pair.
Cute shoe but runs small
Love these shoes! So comfortable and look great!
I love the style and was happy to find another pair of heeled sketcher sandals.  I absolutely love my old pair of Bronze Happy Dayz they no longer sell.  This pair is smaller in length than my other sketcher sandals.  I have not worn them yet to give a review on how they will wear.
Great fit. I'm a 9 1/2,but their 10 fits perfect. Comfy and cute at the same time -- I bought 2 pair!
If you want nice comfortable sandal this is a must have. It is extremely comfortable and nice looking. I don't wear heels, but this I can wear all day.<br />The memory foam cushions each step and the stretchy straps across and between the toes making walking in them easy. These are my new summer go to shoes!
Nice one! I've bought the thind one these years!
Comfortable and fabulous. Love them.
Cute and comfortable.
I love these sandals.  After reviewing the posts, I went with a size 8.  I usually wear a 7-7.5 depending on the brand.  The 8 fits the length of my foot well and is comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that my fit slides around a bit.  I wish the fit around the big toe was more snug, but it still works.  I would recommend them and say they are worth the money.
Had to return these because the color was lighter than what I thought it would be. Also the fit was pretty small. I usually wear a size 61/2 in shoes and I had ordered size 7. It was way too tight.
Way too small, sizing must be off on this product. I returned mine, but might have been ok going 1 full size up.
The &#34;toe whole&#34; is way too small and I cannot wear these for more than a minute.  So cute, but disappointed.  They will be returned.
Great fitting, comfortable sandals.  Lightweight and supportive. This is my second pair in this style, about the sixth or seventh pair of Sketchers.
Same size i always wear but yours were so narrow i couldn't even get my foot 1/2way in them. Why arent you carrying a<br />larger selection of 9 10 and 11's in wide widths
So light and a cute shoe for young or old.  Runs very small.  Order a size up.
Love these shoes!  I will buy this style in whatever colors they offer!!!  These are the only style I wear all summer long!!!
I haven't worn these yet, but I do have to say, that like many others, I am extremely disappointed with the sizing.  I have a lot of difficulty finding a comfortable shoe to begin with, but sizing should not be this much of an issue, especially with an open back shoe. If you normally are a 1/2 size like myself and go up the 1/2 size, your heel is right on the edge.  With no 1/2 size, a 9 would be too big.  I really wanted this shoe, but I am not happy that this shoe is not sized right.
Love them so soft and comfortable to walk or stand in for hours. The shipping was fast too.
Very comfortable.
Love these!!!! Super comfy!!
so comfy!
Very comfortable shoes!
Cute shoes!
Love these shoes. You can literally walk miles in them.
Most comfortable shoes ever!  Love, love, LOVE!
Cute Shoes, but my feet get tired after a while.  To be fair, I have bilateral plantar faciitis, so it's not easy for me to find comfortable shoes.
Love these.  Have several pairs.  So comfortable and nice looking
I don't like the new memory foam on the sole...It is slippery and so my foot is sliding the whole time I am wearing them.  I had a pair like them before without the memory foam and they were the BEST.  Please go back....
I like the style and the footbed is comfortable; however the area around the toes is very uncomfortable. Jabs in between big toe and next toe.
OK
I ordered a size 7 but had to re-order a size 8. Way too small. Thankfully my neighbor liked them and bought the size 7 off me so I didn't have to deal with the exchange.
Too small. I have another pair without the memory foam which are the same size and they fit perfectly. The memory foam is not as comfortable as the rubber insole. I had to return these.
Great shoe!!! Cute and comfortable. Another hit for Skechers!
Super cute and comfy and they don't hurt my extremely high arches!
While the sandal is very cute and comfortable when standing in them, the memory foam makes it very uncomfortable to walk in this shoe, especially more than short distances.  The footbed is very slippery and my feet keep sliding down to the end. Not a good feeling or look. I would prefer the older style with the ribbed foot bed.  And since I found this out after wearing them. I can't return them. Disappointed.  Anyone have any suggestions how to remedy this??
I have Sketchers in this style and love them and I got these because they looked to be cushioned and thought they would be more comfortable; they are comfortable but they are very slick and my feet slide in them. My next ones will be without the cushion.
These are the most comfortable summer shoes I own.  I can wear them all day.  Love these!  I have them in black and grey.  They can be dressy or casual.  I finally found my favorite summer shoe.
Exact same as in the stores at half the price.  Love them!!
I ordered size 7,  yet the size is more like a size 6. I will now need to send back.
They fit well and are very comfortable.
Love these!
I have been buying these high heal Skechers for several years now. I can wear them all day and with anything; they are extremely comfortable. After about 6 months, the foam under my heal compresses, so I buy a new pair.  For this particular purchase I bought the same size I always do, but as many others have stated they feel a bit smaller and tighter, yet still comfortable as the straps tend to stretch.  If I were to do it again, I would order a larger size, but these are doable, and I'm sure will stretch with time.
I have this shoe in black and  silver too! Love them
Soft & Spongy
Most comfortable sandals I have ever worn.  They don't &#34;flip&#34; like flip flops - they are solid, and stay securely on your feet.  The memory foam insole makes walking in these very comfortable.  The bottom is textured, so you don't slide around on concrete
These are super comfortable even as thongs, which usually take me time to get used to not these. They are an all day shopping and work shoe no problem there at all. These can be dressy though. Only downside is the plush fabric insole isn't the greatest idea for durability or ease of cleaning. I haven't had to clean them as much as I thought I would but I don't think they will last quite as long as a some sandals. I have had them three months and they are my go to sandal for the summer. I will be wearing them all summer. I bought two pairs after trying them out at a local store. I'm still glad I did. I'm keeping one for dress up and the other for kicking around all over the place!
This is my second pair of these and I absolutely love them.  They are my favorite, &#34;go to&#34; shoes for warm/hot weather.
It is a very comfortable sandals. i love them. Since this does not come in half sizes, I ordered 7 a year ago and it was a bit big for my 6 and 1/2 foot. So this time I ordered 6 and it is great. I love this sandals and get complement all the time especially from short people like myself.
I absolutely love these shoes.  They arrived a few days ago and I haven't been able to take them off. Truly very comfy.  I'll be wearing them all summer for sure.
Nice cashion and hugs foot well enough not to acquire chin splints walking.
The fabric is not very comfortable. A little bit slippery.
Comfortable and fits great.
These have been very comfortable.  I wore them all day walking around an art fair and they were still comfy at the end of the day.<br /><br />The straps across the top are not stretchy, so they are very fitted.  But with wear they will eventually feel just fine.
Skechers are always a great fit and comfortable.  I like the color and will definitely enjoy wearing them.
I have a very narrow foot and have trouble finding a shoe that fits correctly. These are only slightly too wide for me but extremely comfortable!
One size smaller than the other Cali models I have.
Really cute and comfortable, awesome price
I love them. At first they were somewhat narrow on the toes part, it took sometimes to break in.
I was surprised to find these too small - and I always wear a 6 in Skechers.  I found them in a 7 locally and they are fine.  I think the memory foam and extra padding must take up more room.
It's wonderful but a bit small. I am size 9 in all my sketchers but  would of bought 9.5.
very comfortable shoes!!! I would definitely recommend these.
Shoes are comfort but small for size 7 . Have to send back for size 8.ðŸ˜’
Didn't like them the straps don't hold my foot so it slips forward and it was so much money to return them that I gave up and will give them to someone that can enjoy them,  not good for me
Love them. So comfortable.
haven't worn them for long periods but they seem really comfortable on trying and as if I could walk on & on without any issue.  And they make my feet look good!  however the size 5 was somewhat small for me so perhaps half a size up ie 5.5 would have been better
Comfy as I expected .i had 2 pair  before getting kinda old so I order 3 more pair. I can't leave without . Thx Amazon
Go a size up I've never been any size but a 6 in any shoe I've ever worn and was disappointed when my heel was hanging off the back. So I Gave them to my sister who has a slightly smaller foot then me and reordered a 7 which we're perfect.
Loved the shoes but they run small
I absoltuley love these shoes! I have knee and feet problems and shoes can really set one or both off. I can wear these all day and no problems.
Love !! Super comfortable
They do run an inch smaller than normal.  Gave them to my daughter
Half sizes would be nice.
This product is not  appropriately sized. The  manufacturer should be contacted  immediately.
Comfortable, I love it!
love em!
Just perfect!
I normally wear a size 7-71/2, after reading the reviews I decided to order the 8 & I'm glad I did. Perfect fit. Not sure how they will be for a long day wearing, the strap between the toes seems a little stiff. I have just received these & not had time to wear them for an extended period. I don't find the insole to be slick as some have described, my footing feels secure.
I love these sandals, they are soooo comfortable.  For regular daily wear they are perfect.  I've had foot surgery and can't wear heals anymore, these area happy compromise.  I can still wear sandals in the summer and not have to choose between comfort and fashion.<br /><br />Skechers are my &#34;go-to&#34; shoes for every occasion, if I am going to be walking or standing a lot, I wear my sketchers sneakers.  They keep my feet, legs and back from hurting.
Very comfortable.  Skechers generally run small for me so I ordered the size I get skechers in which is one size larger than normal.  Not a great arch support if you need it.
I would have rated these higher if they were a little wider. I do think they will stretch out a little with wear time, but they are tight around the toes. Definitely good arch support since they are heels.
Very comfortable.  I have bad feet but can wear these
Love these shoes you must size up in these shoes.  I wear a size 9 and since no 1/2 size so I had to order size 10.  I did not experience the sliding that others did.  The toe is comfortable however I would say if you are not use to Flip flops might be something that may bother you.  I love these sandles
I have high arches and these work for me. They are very comfy and cute. I bought them for Disney and they work great. I usually where a 7.5 and I bought an 8. Love them
I really like the memory foam. Can be tight at first.
These shoes are very comfortable except that they run small, I ordered my size and they did not fit and this vendor will not pay for return shipping, so I would suggest that if you want to try this shoe to buy a size bigger and from another vendor,  just in case it doesn't fit.
Fits about 1/2 size small.
My feet slide in them when I walk in them because of the new insole I have gotten the same size with with the rubber insole and they seem to fit me better. I will try them in a larger size next time.
Love these shoes! I could run in them!
Like walking on cushions.  Very satisfied.  No problems whatsoever.  Keep up the good work, Sketchers!!!!
These are so comfy....However The colors I really wanted no longer had my size...I'm disappointed
I love these flip flops!  I live in flip flops year round; even in the snow!  But I don't like flats because then my pants drag on the ground.  I had a similar pair of these (Beautiful People model) that my mom picked up on clearance a couple of years ago.  I have worn them out because I literally wear them every day in all weather.  I went online to replace them and these are exactly the same except for the memory foam instead of rubber.  I didn't think it was possible, but they are even more comfortable than the beautiful people.  They go with everything and I get compliments on them all the time.  Worth every penny!
These silver sandals are so pretty, soft and comfortable ........
Love, love, love these sandals
Very comfortable.
LOVE these.....fit well and look great!
STILL GETTING USED TO IN BETWEEN TOE-THOUGHT THIS PAIR WAS A PERFECT START FOR THAT
Love this shoe
I love sketchers for their comfort and these are a perfect spring/summer pink!
Very good service and delivery sandals were just as I expected
Happy
This was my second pair of Sketchers - I literally wore out my first pair they were so comfortable.  I thought the addition of memory foam would be an added benefit, but it causes your foot to slide forward and my toes looked like they were going to go off the front of the shoe.  I liked the old version, without memory foam.
I have been wearing Rumblers for years.  I usually wear a size 7-1/2 but have always been able to wear a size 7 in Skechers sandals, specifically the Rumblers.  Now that the style has changed to include memory foam on the footbed, the sizing is different.  I ordered a size 7 and they were too small!  I compared them to my other Rumblers and they are like a 1/2 inch shorter so my heel hung over the edge..  Since there are no half sizes, I ordered the 8.  I tried them on in a store first and the 8 fits just like the other size 7's did.  Very odd.  The Rumblers are so comfortable and if I have to do a lot of walking whether it be in Vegas or Disneyland, this is the shoe.  Ordering a new pair for a Europe trip this summer.  Will be bringing all 3 of the colors I own!  :)
Looked better in the photo. Not comfortable as all my other Skechers.
The foam cushion base is slightly heavier than the all rubber sole and my foot tends to slide around on the surface a little more, but all in all the foam is more comfortable.
Love this shoe! So comfortable they feel like sneakers!
I can usually take an 8 and a half - Glad I went with the nine on these as the nine was almost too small in length - very comfortable - light weight - just a bit short for standard sizing
I can't say enough about sketcher shoes, sandals, and sneakers, they feel sooo........good. They are well worth the money hands down. Very seldom you find shoes and sandals that feel like your walking on cushion.  When you have knee problems like I do, purchasing shoes and sandals like Sketcher is a life saver on my foot and knee.  I would do a commercial for free because I believe in Sketcher.  Love ya.
Thankyou
Very comfortable and fit great. I wear a small shoe (size 5) and they are very hard to find. Glad to find in my size
I love these very comfortable shoes!
FANTASTIC! I bought these for my mother and they are the most comfortable amazing sandals EVER! I am going to buy myself a pair! They feel like walking on clouds!!!
In my opinion all Skechers run a little small and narrow so I went a size up. Very comfy for a couple of hours and cute - definitely not walking shoes though. Went shopping in these for about 5 hours and my feet and legs hurt for the next 2 days - so won't wear them except for short walking days but I do love the look and they're great for just slipping out to lunch and such.
Love these..I thought that 10's are too big..usually wear 9.5...so happy happy happy with them..feels good
Hurts in between my toes
Somehow I do not like new style...
Need 2order 1 size bigger than your regular size. The memory foam makes it tight.
Not as comfortable at the toes as I would have liked. Would not wear this all day or for any serious walking. Love the support but might need to make some adjustments at the toes or something.
Love these!!  Almost feels like they are too comfortable to be wearing for shoes.  The are super soft and cute!
Not liking the new memory foam, makes your foot slip and it fits tighter now.  I buy these shoes every year because I wear them all day long at work everyday.  Luckily I also bought a pair of the old ones without the memory foam, I'll be wearing those much more then these ones.
So comfortable!!!!
So comfortable.
feels like a slipper
These are the most comfortable sandals ever! Love them!
I don't like the memory foam, it makes them fit almost tight.  I prefer the older (2 years ago) version without the foam.
I've had another pair of these (in silver) for at least two years now. They're comfortable and appropriate both for casual and semi-dressy occasions. (For example, perfect with a sundress at dinner when you're on vacation but also entirely appropriate with jeans or shorts.) They're very comfortable and never hurt between my toes, as many other sandals with toe straps do.
Have bought these previously from Skechers and the fit was great.  The 9's I bought seem like they are 8's.
They are very cute sandals, but they run small.  I ordered a size 6 (my normal size) and my heel is at the very end of the sandal to where I could have used a 6 1/2 and probably would have fit perfect.  It was a good price and I can wear them so I decided not to return.  I've only worn them for short periods of time and they are comfortable.
So comfortable to stand with. I used this for work and after 8 hours of standing, my legs were ok.<br />The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel like it's slipping in . Not slipping because of wet floor, but slipping like I have to use my toes to hold my feet in the sandals.<br />The size is good, I usually wear 5, and this 5 fits good.
These seem to run a little small.  I normally wear an 8 1/2 size shoe.  These shoes only come in whole sizes.  No halfs.  I ordered a 9 which just fit.
I love Skechers and these did not disappoint. Stylish and extremely comfortable.  True to size and width.
I love these BUT they run a full sz too small. I ordered them in a sz 8 and 9. I usually wear an 8, but I also have wide feet. 9 fit perfectly.
Don't even know your wearing shoes, comfortable to walk in and to wear all day,
Been buying / wearing sketcher shoes and sandals for years now - but this style runs extremely small.  I liked them and the price a lot so I thought I would give them to my 11 yr old daughter who is wearing the next size down from me and they were event too small for her!  had to return them.
I have purchased 3 pairs of sketchers cali rumblers wedge with the toe strap and always order size 7. This style has a cloth insole with memory foam which feels different from the rubbery insole of my old sandals. It felt very snug and when I held the old size next to the new size 7 this shoe was about a 1/2 size smaller. I returned them and exchanged for a size 8 which is about a half size too large, but wearable. I will review the size 8 after I've had a chance to wear it around a bit.
Although I have (and love) at least 4 pairs of this shoe (all without the memory foam), I'm not really fond of this style.  I purchased these because of the memory foam, but find that my feet slips and slides while walking due to the silky material covering the foam.  This makes the shoe itself uncomfortable because it causes my toes to constantly slide into the to separator.  Needless to say that I was really disappointed. I still believe that the memory foam is a great idea for the shoe that I love so much, but I would suggest that they change the material to one that doesn't allow the foot to slide.
They are a little tight on the big toe, but I believe they need to break in a little.  Very Comfortable.  Love them
Insoles are soon comfy.  Just having to break in the toe straps.
most comfortable shoes ever! love the memory foam and light weight, super cute, but they are a tad small. I have a narrow foot, so they fit perfect on the straps. Unfortunately, my heel hangs just a bit off the back :(  they do not come in 1/2 sizes, which would be great.  these are too comfy to return, so I'm keeping them and hope nobody is scrutinizing my feet :D  Overall, love these shoes just maybe order a size bigger!
I love these sandals. Extra comfy, stylish and affordable.
I always wear the same size in sketchers so maybe it's because of the memory foam.  Not at all as comfortable as I hoped
Perfect
I love these sandals! This is my 2nd one. I have small feet - size 5 - and it fits perfectly.<br />It provides a good support for my heels.
Waaaay to narrow. I don't think I have wide feet. I normally have no problems blend with that. But this show is just to narrow. I couldn't get my foot in at all
Very comfortable!
hese are absolutely wonderful. they give you fashion and comfort at the same time, I was very surprised. I was able to wear these as a high heel but with the comfort of a regular shoe. With the memory foam cushioning it took a lot of the impact off of my knees and made it quite comfortable. would definitely recommend these.
I bought these along with another pair of Skechers sandals (different style).  I found it odd that that I ordered both in size 8 but these were a lot smaller than the other pair.  the other pair fit me perfectly.  these looked like they were a size 6.  Perhaps they sent me the wrong size.  there was a tag in the box that had fallen off the shoe and this tag indicated it was a size 8 but they had to have shipped the wrong size.  In any event I was not given the option to exchange for the same shoe so they are going back.  Very sad because they really were cute. :-(
These run a bit smaller than last years model that did not had the memory foam plus the memory foam was slippery when I walked in them. I prefer the rubber sole where my foot felt more secure in the sandal.
I have several pair of this style in other colors, these ran about a size too small
Love it so much!
Immediately after receiving the shoes I put them on and went to run an errand.  True to Sketchers comfort, they fit awesomely! So very comfortable!  I bought these as my go-to sandals for the summer.  I am very pleased and see myself getting a lot of use out of them.  The price was AWESOME!  I just wish they came in other colors (at the same price) instead of just black (the color I got) and pink (at nearly 3x's the price of the black ones).  EXTREMELY pleased with the sandals! I would definitely recommed!
So comfortable ,so light ,I can probably jog on it
I am a teacher and am on my feet all day!  I have been looking for a stylish sandal that can be worn every day and on special occasions.  These sandals are a hit!  They fit perfectly (although the big toe is a little snug).  I always have trouble finding any shoe that can keep my feet comfy all day.  I often come home with sore feet, but not with these sandals!  They are so light and soft that even after a long day my feet are not sore.
Sadly these didn't work for me, the straps were too tight around my toes.  The foot bed was comfy but the straps hurt, had to send them back.
I have purchased Sketcher scandals in the past (that looked exactly like this, minus the memory foam). I have worn those scandals (very comfortably) for over three years. Unfortunately, even though I wear size 6 and my other Sketcher scandals are size 6 (and fit perfectly), this pair was too small so I had to return them.  If you can find the right size, you'll be very pleased.
These shoes are adorable, but run small.  I normally wear a 5 1/2 or 6. I ordered a 6 as anything else is usually way too big.  These are way too small.  My toes would hang off the front edge if I walked in them and they were pretty tight.  So very cute, but just didn't work for me.
A little snug around the big toe, but the memory foam gives to relax the fit.
Not happy
Much too small
Thank you
Wish they fit like 10 more like a 91/2
I needed a 7.5 but there are only full sizes.  Cannot keep these as they are too small.
These flip flops are very cute and more importantly very comfortable.  I know I will be purchasing other colors as well
These sandals are very light and comfortable. Also look nice! Perfect summer sandals!
These Skechers are amazingly comfortable, though I'd buy half size larger for shoe length.  The straps adjust to your toe shape and size.  The shoe contains so much cushion, it almost feels like a slipper.  I'm so happy I purchased these shoes.  Shoes match well with shorts, sundresses, or an casual wear.  They'll be a summer favorite.
Arrived quickly. The fit was a little tight at first but after about an hour of wearing them they loosen and fit very well. Have been wearing them a few days now and they're very comfortable. Have no problems walking in them or doing everything I do daily and plus they're super cute ðŸ˜„
Comfortable and fits as expected
Comfortable shoe and fits as expected
I bought these for a dear friend...she filled out the above questionnaire , but hasn't been able to wear them all day yet...but did say that the hours she wore them they were very comfortable
These are so comfortable!! Right out of the box, I wore them all day. Since I have a wide foot (7.5ww) I order a  9 because they do not make a wide in these. Very comfortable. Love them!
These shoes are beautiful and may be worn with a wide variety of clothes.  They fit smaller than expected.  I usually wear a 7 in this style, but they have changed to memory foam and the thickness of that material will require me to buy a larger size.<br />I have bought a few pairs of these in the past.  I have walked for a few miles in them while on vacation and my feet didn't feel too bad.  No blisters and no break-in period required.  Just buy them!
This slip in sandal really hugs your foot. It feels like a glove. Wore all day and forgot I had them on. Very comfortable.
Great shoes...2nd pair, different color
I am a size 9 wide, however there is no wide selection so I ordered 9b.  They are a little tight but having neuropathy, they are not too tight to cause pain and cramping.  Great arch and very cushiony on the feet.  Felt so good, I ordered a second pair.  At $17, can't beat it!
These are probably the most comfortable sandals I've ever worn! I love that they are so versatile, too. They can be worn with jeans or dressed up. So glad I found these!
Very comfortable and stylish.
best shoes for my feet
I have other Sketcher flip flop sandals and my regular size fits well with those. This pair runs about size smaller and is a little bit wide. I returned this pair and got a size larger.
I bought a seven, should have gotten a 7.5.
pretty as the picture.. and so nice to walk on.. its a little tight on my feet.. but will probably stretch after a few wears.
These are so comfortable, I can wear them all day. I now have them in 4 colors. I look forward to warm weather so I can stop wearing closed shoes and put these sandals on.
Not as comfortable as I had hoped. Maybe they will stretch with time. Will wear them a short time in the beginning to see if they become more comfortable. Love the color & style.
These shoes used to have stretch in the bands across the foot.  They no longer do.  I have a pair from years ago that I love, but the new version is too tight and has no give.
I ordered these in half a size larger as reviews suggested, and they were right.  They fit snugly, without pain.  No cutting into my toes or slipping when I walk.  I haven't worn them for more than a short time so I can't say how they hold up in the long run, but so far no complains and happy with the purchase.
Love these. Had once before few years ago and had to buy again.
they run small.  I will order a size larger, I really liked them
Too small. Not true to size.
Very Happy.<br />im ordering more..
I will be ordering another pair. Thanks for comfortable shoes.
Great
Very comfortable sandals and true to it's size.
so very comfortable, i'm planning to buy more so that i'm never without an extra pair. Wish they had more colors! Tan, White, and more.
Nice fit and super comfy!
These are fabulous! Very comfortable and so lightweight.
Perfect fit!
Very comfortable !
I have around 15 pairs of Sketcher's sandals and they always fit me really well. This pair, however, is extra narrow and they wobble a bit when I walk. I wouldn't purchase this particular style ever again.
I would recommend ordering these a half size larger, other than this this is a awesome Shoe. Perfectly Comfortable allday Shoe. I Will be ordering more of this type shoe. Great Job Skechers!!!!
The most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned! This is my second pair and I am thinking of buying the third before they are gone.
Love them
I love these sandals!! Comfy and cute!
I bought this shoe for comfort and have shredded toes from wearing them only once.  Very disappointed in the lack of comfort.  The memory foam pad is slippery, so your foot slides around while walking... also the &#34;rings&#34; that your toe fits into are too tight -- and in the case of my pair, also uneven in width.  Worst of all, the toe ring chafes against both the big toe and the next one.  Mine are red and raw -- and the shoes are going back.
it's like walking on air
I'm on my feet all day and this shoe is perfect for standing, bending, etc. You are comfortable all day. I love that this has flexible yet sturdy cloth. This provides additional comfort and doesn't require you to &#34;break in&#34; the shoe.
Great show! Stylish and comfort all in one!
Love them!!
They run a touch small. I usually wear 8.5. in shoes and 9 in boots and the 9 fit just right. The heel ends exactly at my heel, there is 0 wiggle room. So comfy! Have been wearing them nonstop. The neoprene-like material stretches to accomidate different foot widths and is very comfy. I have worn it non-stop since I got them. They feel very secure and the height is perfect. Can be dressed up or down and the memory foam sole is divine.<br /><br />I loved them so much that I bought a pair for my mom who has a bad toe bunion and shoes like this usually hurt her. But the soft material covers her bunion and does not dig in at all! She wears 7.5 and I got her the 8 and they fit perfectly. So def order a size up if you're in between sizes.<br /><br />Would buy it again!
First time ordering shoes online, depending on the shoe im anwhere from an 8 1/2 reg to a 9 1/2 wide I always try shoes on before I but them but these looked perfect for what I was looking for so I took a chance & they fit like a dream. My feet feel better than ever & the look casual/dressy depending on your attire. I love them & I bought my mom a pair too!
These shoes are very cute and very comfortable, however, they run a little small. I wear a size 8 shoe but I can also wear some 7 1/2 shoes.  I'm glad that I bought the size 8. I probably could have bought a size 8 1/2 and it would have been ok.
They look even nicer than I expected. Fit perfectly and comfortable.
Very comfortable and supportive
Great sandal holds my foot firm but not too tight. Love the sketcher shoes.
Nice
I wear a size 7 and these are too small
I tried on a pair of these in the store that were a size smaller than I normally wear and they were more comfortable than the size that I ordered from Amazon in my regular size. There was something weird about these. I checked the size on both shoes and they had the size listed that I ordered but there was no way this was right.
very disappointed they donâ€™t come in half sizes
I like the shoes, but they run small. I can wear a 6 in the sketchers sandals, but nit these.
Love these
Too small. I have never had this happen before. I will have to order the bigger size. Too bad these do not come in half sizes. I know I will love these once I get a size that fits.
Still love these Skechers.  So comfortable.  Wish I had gotten these just 1/2 size larger.
Love love love these
Love these sandals!! I have bunions so finding sandals that fit well, look good and that are comfortable not easy!! These definitely fit the bill!! So comfy and cute! Just bought my second pair so I have them for next season!!
really comfy.
Most comfortable sandals I've ever owned.. however, I've slipped sometimes in them because the lining is slippery Might sprain yOur ankle if you wear up and down stairs a lot or something.. other than that there awesome.
Love them...
They fit a little smaller than your actual size.
Great pair of Sandals. Most softest ever.
Very comfy. Well made.
Great shoes
Let me start of with, they were comfortable. But I was wishing these were a little flatter and a stronger bottom. I like the memory foam. The sandals are very light. They are also very slippery, no traction. I live daily in pain due to chronic conditions, and was looking for something flat and comfortable. I previously had a memory foam sandal from Sketchers, and was wishing they were more like them. I am a huge Sketchers fan, but lately have not liked a lot of their products they are coming out with. I never have to worry about sizing when it comes to Sketchers, because they always fit. I just wish they would bring back some of their old styles. I like these straps, they are my favorite; just wish the rest of the shoes were a little more stable.
Wowed by the comfort, but then they are Skechers, so should have expected it.
They are very comfortable. They do not come in half sizes. I usually take a 7.5 and ordered an 8. Fit was just right.
Nice comfy shoes
Best sandals I've ever owned. Super comfortable. Going to buy two more pairs so I always have them!
Years ago I bought a pair of Skechers sandals similar to these, loved them and they lasted for 5+ years. I never could find a pair like them again until I saw these on Amazon. Skeptically I ordered them and crossed my fingers. When I put these on, they were so comfortable and light I couldn't believe it! I have worn them now for a week and love them even more than my old ones! They fit securely on your feet so they're not slopping around and noisey. They are made of cool material that breathes and I wouldn't hesitate to get them wet because of the neoprene feel of the sandals. I'm glad I got them in two colors!!
I really like them!
comfortable, except the strap between the toes starts to hurt after a while.
A little narrow. Comfortable and will be more so when they are broken in
Love all of the Sketcher brand
I love the shoes and normally I can get my regular size and be okay but these do run smaller so I had to reorder a size bigger.
Pretty comfortable would of been better if 8.5 was available
I am in love with these sandals!! I have gone thru 2 prs of the older version-last pair were ready to get thrown away, they were worn out, but I was putting it off-until a dog peed on them. So. I ordered a pair of these not realizing that they were memory foam! But, they are wonderful! So comfortable. I might just have to order another pair! I love every pair of sketches that I've purchased so far -about 10 different styles! But, no matter if it's casual or more formal-I'mready!!
This one fits right unlike the last one I order.
these skechers don't feel like the others.  They hurt a bit.
Love these
Seem to be nice shoes but too wide so had to return them.
Great shoes. Very comfortable.
Very comfortable and fashionable
It feels good and I like the style
They fit well and the color is wonderful ........it does not dominate.  The straps are soft and easy on he toes. No major arch support but that's no problem yet.  I'm considering a second pair.
The sandals are good . Iam 8 , but it runs too wide.
PERFECT!
love these shoes. wish I coul find some more
Love them
I loved these flip flops but unfortunately they broke. I got them fixed once but they broke again. They were really comfortable so I was upset they weren't fixable.
Bought this for my wife. Looks good but fits a little snug on the feet. She's been using it, has expanded over time..
The soles are VERY thick- I didn't realize they were the Shape Ups until they came in. If that's what you're looking for they're still cute, but it's not what I was expecting and returned them.
very pleased with this product
good
Thank you!
Very comfortable!
The straps across the feet are plastic, not fabric, so they rub blisters on both feet. I can't wear them. Which is too bad because they are really cute.
due  to  foot  injury  i  have  lymphedema......severe  swelling  in  foot............these  are  wide  enough  for  bad  foot  and  narrow  enough  for  good  foot................PERFECT  COMFORT  IN  EVERY  WAY  AND  BELIEVE  ME  MY  BAD  FOOT  IS  DEFORMED.....VERY  WIDE  AND  SWOLLEN................I  wear  these  24  hours  a  day......only  wear  wide  zip  boots  for  snow............................i  replaced  the  toneups  which  were  discontinued  with  these  and  love  them  just  as  much.....maybe  more  as  they  are  more  girlie  looking...prettier....more  feminine...................the  v  feature  straps  at  top  are  perfect  for  my  swollen  foot  to  slip  into.......................PLEASE  SKETCHERS  DO  NOT  REPLACE  THESE  WITH  SOMETHING  ELSE........i  need  the  rubber  bottom  with  heel  pad  as  these  are  water  or  pool  or  backyard  hose  friendly.....the  memory  foam  is  not  water  friendly..................have  tried  fit flops  and  allegria  brand  but  the  dye  rubs  off  and  they  are  not  water  friendly.......THESE  ARE  WINNERS  AND  IF  YOU  REPLACE  THESE  I  WILL  HAVE  NOTHING  TO  WEAR  AS  I  BUY  MANY  PAIRS  OF  THESE  SINCE  THEY  ARE  THE  ONLY  SHOES  I  CAN  WEAR
They are heavier than I anticipated so I wear them for a few hours. Dressy flip flop!
BEEN WEARING THIS STYLE FOR OVER 15 YRS!  GETTING HARDER EVERY YEAR TO FIND THEM...SO GLAD I FOUND A PLACE TO PURCHASE THEM.....THANK YOU!
Second pair of these and I love them!
I love Sketchers and had a pair of Tone-Ups a while back. These are not as comfortable as the Tone-Ups. The fit was fine, but the sole was very stiff and hard. Sorry to say I'm returning them.
Happy with purchase
I love these , l wear them everyday. They are so comfortable, & pretty
Ok but not as comfortable as the original Tone Ups. Wake up Sketchers --- so many of us want you to bring back the original Tone Ups!
Love them.  Extremely for long periods of time
I love them!
Great fit and so comfortable even after hours of<br />Walking in them. . Recommend skechers-relaxed-fit-landings-women-s-black-memory footwear to anyone.
My wife loves these sandals! This is her second pair, she had to have them. She loves the comfort and style, and says that they work with all types of looks.
The sandal seems comfy at first, but there is something sharp on the underside of the straps which cause blisters on the tops of my feet.
Very comfortable.  Worn them all day long right out of the box.  I live in my Skechers :)
love them.
I was very disappointed that the sizing was different from the Skecher Tone Ups.  I am a size 7; however, the Tone Ups run a size small.  Therefore, I ordered a 6 in these.  Probably a stupid idea on my part.<br /><br />Also, these didn't have the arch support like I need and like the Toner Ups provide.  (I can't find the Tone Ups anywhere; I'll have to wear a different brand.)<br /><br />They were adorable and I ended up giving them to a friend, since the return and shipping were a pain in the...Katie B.
Love these!  The are very comfortable and look nice too
WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!! They are my second pair and I can walk for miles in them, they are so comfortable with the comfort sole:)Very happy will order more!!!!!
You can't go wrong with these! I'm a size 6-6.5 and got these in a 6, which fit perfectly. I've been looking for some grey thongs that don't look shlubby, and these are a beautiful color with rhinestone detail that achieves that goal completely. The memory foam soles feel like you are walking on a cloud. Sturdy enough construction for walking the dog or light hiking, unlike the more flimsy flip flops that are so common. I would recommend these to anyone...
Can't go wrong with these
Fits and looks exactly as i expected.  Put them on and out the door i went.  Love them
I love them. They are very comfortable.  I have trouble finding shoes that are comfortable on my feet.  I  have arthritis.  These feel great.
Comfy and cute but the strap broke the 3rd time I wore them.
I wear a size 7-7.5, so I bought a size 8 and they were and are perfect!
I was so disappointed that the rhinestones started falling out within hours of starting to wear the shoes!
The sandals themselves are okay, they just fit bad.  The memory foam offers no support.
Have bought many of these, different colors, as they are the only shoe found that gives the support like a good sneaker.  Love them.
L8ve theses shoes
Love, love these shoes! Plan on buying more colors as soon as I have the funds. Had to come back and take a star away : ( The stones are falling off in record numbers, and I've been careful. Oh well, I guess beauty really is fleeting! Still love the shoes though, wish they offered them without the bling so they wouldn't look so trashed so soon.
am enjoying these, and am considering a pair in the chocolate brown color. my sister liked them so much she ordered a pair .
Very comfortable
These Skechers are very comfortable. If  you're a half-size, order up. They have changed the name from the last pair I bought two years ago. Good price. Great shoe.
Very nice. Fits a little snug but it might stretch a little with time so I'll keep it
These are very comfortable.  When they are new they are snug, but they loosen up.  Eventually, they seem to loose.  But very comfortable and cute.  This is my 2nd pair!  And the rhinestones will eventually start to fall off.
This is my second pair.  The stones started coming out of the first pair, so I ordered another.  Now I can replace them and glue them with the extra pair when they fall out of the second pair.  Is that clear?  They are very comfortable and I love them other than this.  Hopefully, this solution will work.
Great Sandals; very comfortable.  I bought two pairs.  I am retired and live in Florida, and the only footwear I ever wear is sandals and the Sketchers never fail in comfot, appearance, and durability.  Loved the brown with the pink trim!
Love these!  I have vertebrates in my back that are bone on bone and these are the only shoes that I can wear in the summer that do not irritate my lower back.  Will be a bad day when I cant find them anymore.  I have 6 pairs :)
Love them.  Though not much arch support the heel cushioning makes up some for it.
They looked long when I got them & arch location was off because of that. I have several pairs of &#34;7&#34;s & the arch fits perfect in them.  Not sure why this pair is different other then length.
I ordered these Skechers since I have another pair of Skechers which I have had for years and love.  This pair is a bit more narrow (I have wide feet) so I am hoping the straps will stretch a bit more but they are well cushioned and comfortable other than the strap so far.  Disappointed in this pair as I have had the same experience others mentioned with jewels falling off after not a lot of time/wear.  The similar pair I have from years ago still has not lost any jewels.
I love them! Just what I have been looking for and they are very comfortable!
I bought these just over 1 month ago and love how they fit and they are so comfortable. But are already coming apart where the toe piece connects to the top part! Don't purchase if you want a pair to last you at least 1 summer :(
I ordered wrong size. Returned for refund and reordered correct size.
Very cute and comfortable. Will purchase more.
I do not know what happened here usually Skechers last for years. Not this pair they broke after a month. I had to buy shoes to make it home. Of course I just missed the return window. I feel as if I just opened a window and blew $50
The one problem I have with them is the raised arrow like thing next to the big toe. I have a lot of nerve problems in my feet due to chemo, and that raised thing bothered me , but I love the shoes, so am hoping I can get used to it. I wear them a lot, and they are better already.
Love these.  My 2nd pair!
These shoes are very comfortable, I wore them all day with no problem.
If you loved Skechers Tone-Ups you will love these.  They appear to be identical (I compared them to an old Tone-Up pair) and feel  the same.  The Tone-Up flip flops were the most comfortable shoes I ever wore. But unlike the Tone-Ups which I had to buy one size smaller these fit perfectly!  One reviewer was annoyed that one of the rhinestones fell off.  I have an expensive pair of Fit-Flops I bought on Amazon that don't fit at all well, are uncomfortable and the jewels fell out the first time I wore them.  You can buy a small bag of rhinestones at a craft store and stick them on with a dab of super glue!
Great Filp Flop !
Love Sketchers sandals and this is one of my favorite pairs. So cute. Comfortable. Versatile, which is what I am usually looking for...can wear with capris or cute sundress or jeans. Will be sad when these wear out. The white is equally nice.
I love these shoes! they are great for a wide foot also and they have great arch support.<br />My sister-in-law loved them also and wants me to order a pair for her. (they feel like the skechers shape up but better)
i ordered these in march and i just now put them on yesterday june 8th 2015 and wore them for 4 hours and the strap is already coming away from the bottom of the shoe and i have lost a couple of rhinstones to. i went on here and because i ordered them from amazon my return or replace item is already expired and i am not happy at all. please go find your self a different pair of sandals theses are not good quality that you would expect from skechers brand.
Have them in all colors.  Extremely comfortable and attractive as well.  Only wish the stones were more secure.  They tend to come off and of course lost.  I have bought some at a craft store and glue them back on.
Great shoe, comfortable. What else is there to say.
Love the color. Great to slip on and go.
Cute and comfortable!
These Skechers Cali flip flop sandals are cute and comfortable.  They fit me perfectly.
I love these. They are so comfortable and have lots of cushion. A very sturdy flip-flop
Love them!  So nice to have a pair for summer when wearing white!!
The sandals are always perfect.  I really love them.
Love them
Love em.
Comfortable. They seemed slightly big but that is probably because they are chunky.
I love these!!
Great Arch support and thick shoe.  Love it
wanted to like them but they are not wide enough
I love these flip flops.  I will be buying another pair in the near future, just a different color.  They fix well and are very comfortable!
They are so comfortable....I work standing so they are great...little height, and support
I have plantar faciatis and they provide the necessary arch support
Live in these shoes. They are great. Will be back for more colors.
Awesome  Sandle love them
I ordered a size 11 and they fit someone with a size 10, so i gave them away
These shoes are cute and super comfortable. The best thing about them though is that they are high-quality shoes. These are not flimsy flip-flops; they are sturdy and rugged which is why I bought them. I am very pleased.
very nice and very comfortable
Even though I have had several pairs of this shoe..this pair is only a week old and 10 rhinestones have already come off of the straps ,...very disappointed
In LOVE with these!!! My knees feel good and my feet look great! Thank you Sketchers!
Love them
I expected the shoes to be super soft and comfortable right when I got them. They were not, but I wore them for a couple hours everyday and they eventually conform to your foot and you can feel the mushiness, as I call it. So give them a chance.<br />Now I always want to wear them! I bought these for an upcoming vacation. Now I plan to only pack these and the rest of my sandals can stay home!
as described
Sort of nice looking- like a glorified flip flop. The foot bed id thicker and padded of course. Don't think my feet would be comfortable all day. Maybe others will  have a different experience.I am hoping for the usual Sketchers quality. Too soon to tell.
Perfect support & perfect summer sandals that are versatile!
Perfect
Not what I was expecting. These 'sandals' have more of a cheaper 'flip-flop' feel when you walk in them.
Very comfortable!
I love the Tone Ups! Great support - great price!
I have worn this brand of these shoes for several years now and just love them.  They are very comfortable, provide good cushioning and support. My feet actually feel great at the end of the day!
Love Sketchers always buy them they have great support and comfort
I hadn't even worn these across my living room before the rhinestones started coming off of the straps. I feel so cheated. I wore them so I can't send them back but I spent over 30 dollars for sandals that aren't worth 10. They are comfortable and cute, so this is a really ridiculous cosmetic (and easily fixed by Skechers) design flaw and a damned shame.
very nice - tight at first but loosened up quickly.
Good but not the best  I've had not as comfy as I expected  have had  many others but still they work for me
Love these shoes!! They are very comfortable for my sore feet!
Stiff cheap returned
Love
love the look and the soles but the straps are little wide for my foot.
Love these - they are better than the Rumblets, not as flat but the same cute style.  I love the little extra width of the relaxed fit.  And the price (compared to Skechers.com and outlet store which was $55) is great.
nice and stylish
Total rip-off.  At almost $50 a pair you expect some quality - well there is none!.  I had the first shipment replaced.  The second pair was faulty too. Kept the best of the worst.  Terrible Chinese quality.  Sketchers have gone DOWN in quality - they are not what they used to be for number of years now.  The materials are cheaper, there is no foot support in 99% of their products.  The cost to make a shoe or sandal to Sketchers is less than $2 a pair.  You all know what you pay for them. Save your money and buy similar ones at Walmart or some other place for less than $10.
very comfortable, good support and pretty too.
great shoes!
Very comfortable. Love them
I love Skechers and I live in them as soon as the weather starts getting warmer. I can't say enough good about how comfortable they are, even after a full day of being on my feet.  I have been wearing 3 pairs of size 6 Tone Ups, but the model has changed and the closest I could find was the Relaxed fit.The Tone Ups were about a half size larger than my other size 6 sandals. These are like a full size smaller. I am hoping that the straps will stretch out a bit with time so that my foot can move about 1/4 of an inch forward since there is 3/4ths of an inch between my longest toe and the front edge but my heel is right at the edge on the back.
Love them so much.  My second pair of blk. ones.  I just wished the rhinestones would stay on....maybe they should be clamped in the strap and not just glued on.  Also, provide you with extra rhinestones to glue on for later.
Love them
my new walking sole
Got Blisters from the straps.. comfy foot sole.
These Skechers are super comfy and very nice looking. I believe they run a bit big ... if they had been 1/2 size down, they would fit me better.
I don't usually order shoes without trying them on first.  However, since I love Amazon and their return policy is very good I decided to take a chance.  I ordered these and they fit exactly as expected.  I love them.  They are comfortable and I would definitely order again in the future.
Love, love, love these flip flops!  So comfortable.  Perfect fit and I can wear them all day!  Not sure how long the beads will last though...  Really nice flip flops - great color (gray).
I have horrible structure in my feet and these correct them comfortably. When I wear them, I have less pain in my lower back and I walk everywhere in them. I always wear them when I know I will be walking a lot, yet they are pretty enough to where with dreses to church, out to dinneer ,etc...  You will not be disappointed.  A very happy customer.
the new design has eliminated the great arch support I need...I will be looking at other options. Sketcher please bring back the original design.
Great , very comfortable
I love them!  Very comfortable to wear all day.
This sandal is great with almost anything for spring and summer.  The beige and white color goes with most of my wardrobe, and the style is great.
They don't come in half sizes. I am 7 1/2, so I ordered a size 7 based on other people's reviews that said the sandals run big. But they are too small and too narrow. I will exchange them for an 8, and hopefully those will fit.
i wish they had a higher arch support like the tone ups
Great shoes! Comfortable & nice looking.
Cute and comfortable
I love these shoes I want them in every color!  Best purchase ever!!
Very comfortable & light weight.. i have a wider foot and these fit perfectly !  Very pleased !
Very comfortable and look very well-made. These look Beautiful on my feet!
Somewhat snug and not super comfy...just average in my opinion.
I really like the sandals, they are so comfortable and the look really nice ... my only wish was that they came in half sizes as I really need a 7 1/2.
Love my Skechers
Love these sandals. I have a narrow foot but they still fit well.
They are so comfortable, I will other another pair soon.
Love them
she loves them
Love them
Came a little snug but with a few wears really stretched. Straps are a little to slack now
The roof of the inside of the sandals are made of rubber. Walking in these will give you a rash. Very uncomfortable to even stand in.
Very comfortable!
My wife loves them. She says that she &#34;is walking on a cloud&#34;
I love these sketches, they are just a bit wide at the strap,  but so comfortable. Would like to get another pair, if the price is right.  Recommend highly.
I really like the way these look and feel, however, they are a bit too roomy through the thong. I have a relatively narrow foot so my foot slips around in these. I wish the fit was a bit more snug so I could  wear them for longer periods of time. I sometimes worry that I will trip because they're so roomy. I really only wear them around the house.
I returned the shoes, because one shoe was smaller then the other.
Great looking and very comfortable
Order a size larger than you think you need. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 so I ordered an 8. I could have used a 9.....which I've never bought for any shoe before.
I went down 1/2 size and they fit perfectly.
Was mistaken in assuming the footbed would be as wide as my Skechers Tone Ups.Footbed is a little too narrow but i know going up to size 10 would be too big.They are comfortable on my feet all things considering!
The shoes are cute and quite comfortable, but the fit is a bit off. There was a gap between where my foot fit against the top of the sandal. I had to return.
I have other sketchers that are similar in style. You need to size up 1 size, and I did after reading the reviews. On my others I did not have to size up. I am a size 5 and the size 6 in this style fit me perfectly. Just like my others that are size 5. They run on the narrow side which is why I like them. My foot is very straight. I have no problem with any of mine that have a wide strap like this. It keeps my foot in place. Very very cute on. If you have a wide foot and a very high arch this may not be the style for you.
I don't think it matters what size you order.... the strap is the problem. It is so wide at the sides that one would have to have padding on both sides. There is no way to adjust the strap.  On my foot the length was fine and width of shoe was fine for me. But that strap is so wide I couldn't walk ...as I was literally dragging the back of the shoe. I just ordered a return pickup. I have worn skechers for years and never had a problem. Nice shoe. Bad strap!! They can't provide good arch support because strap won't let them stay on feet
These shoes look great, but the fit is not true. They are very clunky and just aren't comfortable at all. The shoes are surprisingly heavy. I feel like they run a little small too. Overall, they are just too heavy to be comfortable flip flops. I would not buy these shoes again.
The fit is to size but these are the most uncomfortable flip flops I've ever bought.  I am really disappointed because sketchers is my go to shoe for comfort.
Fit as expected.
Not as comfortable as Sketchers Tone-up Flip Flops, but the price was good.  They are attractive.
They were not as comfortable as I expextedd
Fits great... Perfect!
not wide enough
They were cute but to small around the arches.
Flip Flops were EXTREMELY narrow.  I have worn Skechers for years and never had a pair this narrow in my size.  I had a friend with a narrow foot try them and she could not get them on.
Love these Sketchers!!! They are gorgeous and super comfortable. The memory foam insole is terrific.
Love â¤ them
The sandals arrived in box labeled 'Relaxed Fit' and were too wide/loose. Description never said 'Relaxed Fit' so I was very disappointed. A regular width shoe would have been perfect.
I always wear a size 9 Skecher sandal. These were great looking but very narrow and ran small.  First time I ever had that happen.  I returned them and didn't reorder because they were so narrow. I don't think ordering a size up would work because of that.  Disappointed because they were so cute.
feels to small .. not for me .. sent back.
OMG!!! Best flip flop, from Sketchers! I had a pair of Sketcher Tone Ups, for about 4 yrs, and the thong just broke. Found these on line and so glad I did. Awesome!!! Can be worn w/ jeans or a casual dress, comfy,comfy,comfy!!! I have a wide foot, and have plenty of room. True to size, a 9 fits perfect! They have a relaxed fit w/ memory foam, which feels very sturdy! Opened them, put them on, and feel, like I have had them for years!
Horrible.  Very disappointed because I love skechers.  These were nothing like my other skechers!  Don't bother!  Very tight and uncomfortable, I don't usually have any problems with skechers, but these feel like they are not the real deal.
I bought these for a friend, and she loves them
Love the shoes!
I love them!
cheap look , the big strap is tight , the strap near the toes is wide , and cheap material , dont recommend it
Technically, these are the correct size but, as other reviewers have noted, the strap across the toes on one shoe is way to long, with no way to adjust. I can probably wear them, but they look odd. I have ordered another pair which hopefully will not have the same problem and will return the first pair. I own the same shoe in navy and love them. Virtually every pair of shoes I've purchased in the last 10+ years are Skechers and this is the first problem of any kind.
I love mine so much and purchased a pair for my best friend and she loves them.  Two of my closest friends now wear them.  Great and fashionable.
Most comfortable shoe ever
My Sketchers fit perfect & r very comfortable with memory foam insoles.I got an 8 & that was great for me.
my sister in law loves them
good, but a little bit stiff.
They are beautiful, I wish I can keep them but they are not comfortable when walking due to they have a piece on side of foot that rub against your skin and can cause blisters, I love scketchers comfortable for walking specially if you are a diabetic, this is the problem with these sandals. They are nice looking and look beautiful in you feet. Sorry I have to return them.
These shoes are very cute, however, after reading all the reviews about how they are tight across the arch and toes, I still decided to buy them. The reviews are right, the right foot fits fine, and the left foot is way too tight on the arch and the little toe gets squeezed, so after pulling and trying to spread the two straps of the left shoe, I can wear these shoes for awhile, I get lots of compliments on them, but until I can get the straps to loosen up on the left foot, I can't wear them for a long time.
The front band on the shoe is a little wide the back band is perfect. All and all like the comfort of the shoe.
The second strap toward ankle does not flex and left blisters.  Will not wear them again.
Very pretty and comfortable.
The strap across the toes pinched my littlest toe and the strap across the upper part of the sandal band was loose and actually bigger on one side.  Poor quality and not comfortable memory foam seemed very hard on the feet.
Skechers are generally my favorite shoe brand ever, but I'm pretty disappointed with these.  First off, the color &#34;Sand' should really just changed to &#34;beige,&#34; these are much darker than the picture shows.  Secondly, the fit of these is just really off.  The strap across the toe is stiff and a little tight, so it really cuts into your big toe and pinky toe.  The back strap is huge, it stands up at least a half an inch above my foot.  It looks very strange when wearing it.  There are a few rough spots on the inside edge of the straps that rub, and I know it will cause blisters if I were to wear these for any length of time. I was expecting something cute and comfy that would wear well with leggings, but these just look huge on my feet and don't feel good at all.  I'm returning, unfortunately and looking for something different.
Thank you I love it.., I would order again in future days... I've been to few sketcher store and I never find this style I'm glad that I try Amazon ....
Strap across the middle part of my foot has given me blisters. I don't think this part of the show will &#34; break in&#34;, so I will need to tape my foot to prevent further pain.
I was able to wear these sandals on everyday while on vacation.  They were so comfortable and the color poped with my outfits.  I going to order them again in the blue this time.
These did not work for me and returned them.
very comfy! wore them on a cruise and walked all day in comfort
Love love LOVE these!  So comfy!!!!!!  Really beautiful and sparkly, too!
Very comfy, would not hesitate to buy again.
Very comfy. Good quality construction.
A birthday present and she loved them.
I have a very high arch, and these sandals hit my foot just wrong.  They are very pretty, however, and if I don't have to do a lot of walking, are OK
Good for short distances, but the &#34;yoga surface&#34; squeaks for longer walks
Great shoes very comfortable
It's too wide
Very comfortable.
I think they are fine. I was trying to replace a pair of skecters i have had for years and these are not those, but are fine. Work okay.
comfortable and light !!!
Very comfortable. Love them especially around the house!
I've had many pairs of Skechers and love them.  I've had to give up on my all time most favorite ones with the rhinestones because the rhinestones fell off immediately on my last (of several) pair.  I thought I'd try these because if the jeweling falls off,  it won't be so noticeable.  Unfortunately, while these have cushy bottoms which feel nice (though there is no arch support which my others had) the top part is so loose after one wearing that I can barely keep them on my feet.  I've never had this problem with any other Skechers, which usually are attached far enough back on the bed to stay comfortably on your foot even if you were jogging.  These flop around and I have to really concentrate and grip my toes to not walk out of them.  While they're okay for a quick trip to the market, I won't be walking miles in them during travels which I did MANY times with my others.  Back to the drawing board - or maybe another brand.
nice
Like walking on a yoga mat!
If you have a wide foot it, they will be a little tight.
Beautiful!  A little stiff across the top. Will wear for short distances and see if they soften. Soles are very comfortable. Think I could have worn 1 size smaller.
Good fit & quick delivery!
I wear these daily and they are still comfortable at the end of the day.  I have no knee or back pain like I do with other sandals.  I've had mine for about a month and plan on purchasing the same thing in other colors/styles.  They look adorable with sundresses and the glitter/stones have held up well.  I highly recommend these.
The top straps are just a bit loose for me. So I am careful as I walk, I do not want to turn an ankle. Sole is very comfortable, they are pretty.
So comfortable. I have them in black and white. I had foot surgery and can't stand to wear a shoe yet, but needed more than just a cheap flip flop. These are great. Very true to size.
Gave me blisters
On time, perfect fit, exactly what I wanted.
These are very comfy, yet dressy sandals! Wearing them in a wedding this summer.
Very comfortable!
These are the most comfortable flip flops I own. At first I was skeptical about purchasing them because I had some that I wore all the time until they started falling apart. Now I am so glad I replaced them with these.  They feel so good and as soon as I get home from work, I immediately put these on. I love the way they make my feet feel instantly relaxed. Great purchase! They are called Yoga Foam for a reason!
Very comfortable and stylish
I recently had surgery on my left foot and have had problems finding something comfortable and supportive. These are great.
I wore these two times and the gems started falling off.  I usually love Skechers but these are not worth the money!
Strangely, the thong between the toes is VERY uncomfortable.  It really hurts.  I wore them around the house for a couple of days on carpet just to see if I could get used to it or see if they would break in,  but it didn't seem like they would break in. The pain is not a pinching, its a rubbing of plastic. It bites into the skin.  Otherwise these are as advertised, Fit well and very comfy like walking on a yoga mat.  I was disappointed with the thong.
These really look good on your feet.  The arch support is fine, but not as good as some of their other styles.
So comfy!
I have a number of Skechers shoes and love them but am extremely disappointed in these.  The sole is fine but the upper part is extremely uncomfortable.  The top part is made of a stiff material that chafes the foot - a softer material would have been better..  Skechers would have been smart to put elastic into the sides of the strap so it would fit the foot better - as it is I have to contort my foot to keep them from sliding off.  I have worn a number of flip-flops over the years without any problems but much as I have tried, I cannot adjust to these.  It is too bad because it is a pretty looking shoe that I could have gotten a lot of use out of.
True to size, no irritation between toes, easy on the feet due to thick soles.
Love them!
i love this flip flops so pretty and sparkily
Very comfortable , very pretty, the inside sole very soft.  I always wear size 8 , but I bought these size9, fit very well.
They are simply Awesome!!! like walking on clouds!!
Very comfortable!
Extremely comfortable and goes with everything!
Love the look and the feel of these. Very comfortable.
This slippers are too uncomfortable to wear.  The strap is too tight but the sole is somewhat wide.  I can't wear it for more than 10 minutes without getting blisters.  I bought it in time for summer but I don't think I am walking in this slippers outdoor. It's not worth the cost at all.
Comfortable and very cute! Love them!
I love these. They are so comfortable, like walking on air.
Perfect!
Love love love them
Great classy dressy but comfy sandal
Very disappointed!  They were nice looking on and they were my size but they were EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Wore them for no more than an hour and What ever was used to make the top part of the flip flop dug in to the top of both my feet. The tops of my feet were red and sore. I had to take them off and go barefoot the rest of the night. I DO NOT recommend them
Stylish and comfy!
Love them! So comfortable. Also like the fact they do not turn the bottoms of your feet black. Will for sure be purchasing another pair!
Comfy Shoes.
Wore these for days upon receipt; really comfortable.
Love them
Cute platform sandal, beading adds dressy touch
Blisters!...at the top and between my toes.
They just didn't fit from the top of the thong part to the bottom where my sole goes.  Otherwise, they're probably great shoes.
These flip flops tend to run just slightly on the smaller size. I normally wear a 7 or 7.5 and I purchased an 8.  They fit well.
I wish I had ordered a size smaller. They are a bit too loose.
THE most comfortable shoes on the planet. Worth every penny of the wonderful sale price! Do your feet a favor and buy these... in every color!
I gave them to a friend as they were to wide for my feet and the 'yoga mat' sole felt a little weird - very spongy.
I had these for less than a month when the side of the strap pulled out of the flip-flop. I am a 52 year old woman and - believe me- I do not run in these shoes. They still look brand new but are worthless to me now. :-(.  I would return them but I cannot find the receipt - and don't remember what store at the Sawgrass Mill mall I purchased them from. :-(
Great as expected!
I Love this shoes very comfortable
LOVE THEM!
Great
I love them!
perfect love them
Same as the white pair since they are identical shoes.  Good summer shoe that is comfortable and sporty.
for a couple of months the bottom of my right heel has been hurting and I could not wear any of my sandals I couldn't even walk so I ordered these and I love them I wish all shoes was this comfortable  I ordered one pair I love them so much I ordered three more.. I love the fact because they're not too bulky and are not too flat just perfect I ordered the black ones in the Silver ones I wish you have more colors... Just letting all you girls know if you ordered him you do have to go up a size I wear in eight in an open shoe so I had to order a nine ''' ''''''''''''''''''''
These are cute and well-made flip flops.  I have heel spurs and these shoes have a nice cushioned sole which is really comfortable.
Great slippers!  They are as soft as it is advertised to be and I enjoy wearing them.  I gave it a 4 because the strap rubs against the tops of my feet making it uncomfortable.  The tops of my feet are not high, so I am thinking that once I wear it a few more times it will get better.
More comfortable than expected. Originally rated 5 stars but the silver coating between the toes began to come off after only a few uses.
I love these sandals. My feet are a little wide. Thay are very comfortable.
They are definitely cute shoes, but not comfortable enough to wear for more than an hour.  Very little arch support.  I wear them when I plan to sit down for awhile, not walk for awhile.
Have not worn them yet but I am sure I will love them.
I had to return these because the top portion of the  sandals was too tight. I have narrow feet too. Disappointed because they are super soft and comfortable otherwise.
Fantastic shoe.<br />Bought a pair for next year.
If you have a high arch, avoid!!
Love these. Especially the color!
Loose fit and hurt the top of my feet
I have a narrow foot and can wear these, but they are too tight and not comfortable.  The foot bed is soft and provides good cushioning, but the straps are not comfortable and they rub between my toes.
I love them. Feel great, feel good and look nice. Just what wanted and expected. And the price was awesome. Under $20.00.ðŸ˜€
Very comfortable. Seem to be good quality. I like the thicker sole. Great value for the price I paid.
Perfect for hot summer months.
I love Skechers wedges. These are so comfortable! Yoga mat technology indeed!
While they are a bit shorter than expected they fit and feel great.  They are comfortable and I am like how they look.
nice
Love the Yoga Foam soles. Very squishy and comfortable. This is my second pair and I will be buying more.
Fit great out of the box!
I love these shoes! I broke my right leg and tore all the ligiments in my right ankle with a high impact break.  These support my problem ankle and are soooo comfortable.  I have two pair of Sketcher yoga foam shoes.  I wish all shoes were made this comfortable! Highly recommend these shoes!
Love these!
Great flip flops! Have heel Spurs on the back of my heele and these flip flops give me the support I need. Perfect heel height. Like the gray color too!
Love them, very comfortable.
I love these Sketcher flip flops! I bought a pair at the Sketcher store, and then ordered myself two more pairs, and other pair for my Mom, on Amazon! So comfy! Love the yoga mat cushion!
I live in flip flops and these aren't that comfortable.  Strap across top of foot causes pain.  It hasn't stretched or softened up with wear.
They are a cute flip flop.  However, they aren't very comfortable between the toe.  It is leather and tends to rub.  Definitely not an all day flip flop like I was hoping.
These are the most comfortable flip flops with a small wedge that gives you a little added height!  I'm very happy with them.  I wish they had them in Brown!
Go to next size up
The strap looks much more substantial than it is.  Very flimsy and not good for walking at all.  Should have returned them.
Love them
My favorite shoes! Omg. So comfortable!
I'm returning them
Kind of big on the straps,
love these fun funky shoes
great shoes....
I have only had the flip flops for a few weeks and have worn them just a couple of times. Not even for an entire day. Rhinestones have already come off. I'm afraid that more rhinestones / bling will follow suit. It is a comfortable flip flop but because of the loose rhinestones it is not worth the price or frustration.
Very comfortable and fits true to size.
I bought these somewhere else for my 12 year old daughter and they broke in less than a month. Would not recommend. Also, the white bottom got filthy the first day and could not be cleaned.
Love these, cute,comfortable and priced right
Love these, don't hesitate to buy them !
Super comfy for wearing all day long.  I took these on vacation with me to the beach and wore them both day and night.  Never needed any other of the flip flops or sandals I packed!  The rhinestones have survived all-day wear, along with walking through the sand at the beach, spraying off with water coming in from the beach and the rhinestones are all accounted for.  I like the slight wedge heel on the back for added height.  My only compliant would be that the straps stretched significantly after wearing the first day.  I would still purchase another pair in a heartbeat though!
Very comfortable. I wore these around NYC all day and loved them. I wish they made half sizes though. I usually wear a 7.5 and ordered an 8 and they are just too big for my foot. I wonder if I should have ordered a 7.
Love these! Very comfortable! I'm back to buy another color.
I love the look of these sandals and the memory foam is VERY squishy and comforting.  I have a wide foot and was happy to have the footbed of these fit great in the normal width.  The only negative for me is the straps are quite long and loose.  If the straps were a bit tighter, they would be wearable for heavy walking.  With the straps being loose, there is too much work involved in trying to make sure you don't walk out of the shoe and trip!  I'm surprised too, since sandals are usually too tight on me in a normal width.  They are fine for most days and shopping, but if I'm doing a lot of walking at one time, I won't wear them.
I purchased these before I went on vacation, and they were fantastic! Really soft, and great for walking on the beach. Plenty of sparkle, too. Exactly what I needed!
Love, love, love them!
These shoes are heavy.  They are also not comfortable for a long period of time. I am going to buy different shoes and gives these away:(
great as expected!
Love them...this is my second pair.
Love them, very ccomfortable
I have been wearing this flip flop from a few weeks now. I have thin feet and so I have trouble finding the right flip flops. These are a little loose for me but they have met my expectations. They are very pretty looking. I do not think I can walk long distances with it but they are good for wearing to a shopping mall or grocery stores. The material is very soft and comfortable.
These sandals are very comfortable and are so pretty.
Good quality shoe at a fair price. Very comfortable.
I wear them all the time especially on the weekends.
Very well made and comfortable!
I love these flip flops! They feel like you are walking on clouds! But I am a 10 usually and I wish I had gotten a 9.5. They run a little big.
Love them
I wore these for the summer and found the strap stretched out.  The previous flip flop I bought 2 years before lasted much longer.  I'm not hard on them and I am surprised.  Quality is not the same.  Feet slip out of the sides when walking sometimes.  I prefer the thin strap and it shouldn't stretch out.  The company needs to review their product.
Stylish and comfortable; like shock absorbers for your ankles and knees!
Cute flip flops...just wish they were a tad wider.
Dressy and casual
Super squishy.  Very comfortable
It is perfect for what it is, a sandal. A little loose, but not bad.
So comfy!  I already ordered a second pair!!!  Well made with Yoga Foam!  LOVE THEM!
Great shoe! I have foot pain and these shoes are great for me!
Pretty and comfortable but a little big.
Great shoes you can dress up without wearing high heels . Brenda
its like walking on pillows
I wish they came in half sizes
Love Love these Flip Flops! They are so comfy and super cute I plan to buy them in every color!!
Very comfortable.  I'm size NZ6, so I bought size 6.  Perfect!
Very comfortable
Excellent
This is the nicest dressy pair of casual shoes. Skecher's understands the value of the yoga mat sole. I will wear these forever! I can walk, do yard work or dress up and go out in them.
Very comfortable. Arrived quickly. I am very pleased
I'm almost 50 have allot bone problems<br />hope rheu don't stop making thI'd shoe<br />I got extra s
Sooooo soft and cushiony on your feet.One of my favoritr pairs of Sketchers sandals.
BLACK WITH WHITE STRAPS THAT LOOK VERY STYLISH. SMALL RHINESTONES THAT APPEAR TO SPARKLE, BUT NOT OVERDONE. GOOD TO USE FOR MY HEALTH CLUB AND SWIM TIME. YES, THEY ARE COMFORTABLE.
This sandal is more of a thick flip flop than a real sandal.  It looks very good on, but doesn't have the arch support that I'm used to from Sketchers.
I WAS ABLE TO WALK FOR HOURS IN THESE SHOES/THEY  ARE SOOOOO COMFORTABLE!!!!!
Put them on immediately and felt like walking on cushy cotton balls. Never any discomfort through toes. Very, very, comfortable. I will be buying another pair soon.
My mom loved it and it provides great support for her feet and ankles.
Like...love them!
Haven't worn them yet but feel good out of the box.
Adorable and fun!
Love these shoes!! I'm constantly getting complements on them
I love them.
Really cute and comfortable! Fit perfect!
Amazing and comfy BUT STRETCHED OUT after a day wearing them so now they don't fit the best
very comfortable
I ordered the wrong size (5) - I have sent them back and will be ordering my correct size - 8
Good for the pool area.
Love these flip flops, who needs heels...
Very comfortable under the feet and I love the bling for when plain old flip flops won't do. I wear them often and they still don't show signs of wear.
totally comfy
The flip flops fit great, they are so comfortable . And are really cute too
Love these shoes
I love sketchers
Nearly a year later, these are still my favorite flip flops!  They're squishy, supportive and great for being on your feet all day.  In general, I'm a big sketchers fan!  I'd definitely buy these again once mine wear out.
Took a long time to arrive.. fits nice very comfortable.. bottoms get dirty easily also turned my feet black after a few wears ..
So amazingly comfortable!
This are made large. I wear a 10 and I order an 8. These are the best flip flops or even shoes I have ever owned. They are incredibly comfortable. I own 3 pairs and I would buy more if needed. I would recommend these for anyone who is looking  for comfort. You can walk around everywhere in these and u will not get blisters in these. If u are going on vacation and you are going to do a lot of walking,  these would be perfect. You wouldn't think flip flops would be great for miles of walking . They are also well made and good quality.   They are super cute also.
I love these flip flops! They are very comfortable. I can wear them all day with no problems. I'll be buying more!
I absolutely love these, and so comfortable!
The arch support is okay...it could be better.
my wife will not wear any other sandals
Very cute, love them!
I have slightly-wide feet, depending on the shoes, and I like the fact that the soles aren't too thin. Most women's thongs are cut too thin on the bottom for them to look right on my feet, but these are perfect.
the only thing is a little bit heavy.
very comfortable
I really like the egg-crate surface of these flip-flops.  I can wear them all day, except if I am walking and standing for more than a couple of hours.  I do not blame these flip-flops for that, because I have bad feet.  These are much better than flat flip-flops.
So far I love.. Honestly purchased for a vacation so haven't worn them yet other than to try on and walk around the house.  They seem to be really comfortable as most sketchers are :)
Love them!!!
Everyone loves these shoes including me! Defiantly one of my favorites!
Very comfy
a little bit small
I am very pleased and I don't think you can expect arch support from flip flops.
I returned them.
Nice shoes.
Love these, so comfy.
Very cute!
Sketchers Flip flops are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I am still wearing my 2 pairs that I bought over 10 years ago.
The yoga foam is wonderful, but the underside of the top strap that lays against you skin on your foot is so rough and it hurts. Also, the part that goes between your toes is also rough and that hurts too. I had to send the flip flops back.
great item
Absolutely comfortable! I love these shoes. I frequently wear to work where I stand long hours.
Great all day!!
Fit well, looks good,however, constantly rubs blister between left toe.
Excellent pair of Stud Flip.
Comfortable
I like the skechers flip flops.they're really nice looking.They bothered in between my toes a little but I'm sure as I wear them more they'll be fine
I love the squishy foam. And that's the best part. The bad thing, however, is that the top strap is located poorly and is lined with a rough material so that after even 15 minutes the top of my feet were feeling bruised from the pulling and scraping of that top strap. I can't wear these at all and it makes me sad since I think the footbed is great, but that top strap is very very poorly made and your feet will be sorry if you get these.
A great everyday sandal you can walk all day in them and your feet won 't hurt!
Love them<br />I wear them all year
Like walking on marshmallows!
I've only wore these for about an hour or two around my house. The sole is really cushy. They look adorable on. I can't wait till summer so I can wear them outside in the sunshine!
Very comfortable for casual wear. Will not wear on long walks since the strap tends to chafe. Otherwise, for daily wear, standing and just going out, they are perfect!
Felt good but the straps across the top of foot are way too loose
Very comfortable, excellent arch support
These are just okay. Not nearly as comfortable as the original Skechers
So comfortable ....
First sketcher's product I hated. They are uncomfortable and I can barely walk inthem. Probably why they are so cheaply priced
These are stated as being New, but they just arrived extremely dirty they look gray, the tag on the bottom is worn and you can see a little wearing on the inner right bottom heel, the right shoe top feels about an inch wider than the left like it's been stretched out. First time I've been dissatisfied with anything I bought from Amazon...
Very comfortable to wear!  I haven't walked in them a lot yet but I do intend do get some mileage on them soon.
I have really bad foot problems: bunions, flat feet, multiple surgeries, etc. These were so comfortable, I was able to wear them all day long the very first time I wore them. They are very attractive, too!
Love them!!
The yoga mat sole on these shoes feels fantastic. I just got them last night and walked around the house in them, and they were very comfortable. I will see how long they stand the test of time, but just out of the box they are all ready to go. I have a wider foot and these were just fine on me, and the straps fit comfortably.
STRAP IS A BIT ROUGH/STIFF BUT THE CUSHIONY SOLE MAKES UP FOR IT
Spinal injuries doesnt allow me to walk barefoot without back pain so I tried these. The shoe bed is excellent! I bought three pairs I loved them so much, however the straps stretch too quickly so theyre falling off our feet easily and I trip constantly now. I love love love these anyway for comfort. I just walk differently to keep them on when stretched.
Very nice
Not what I expected.
Like
I wore for few hours, I find the shoes very comfortable - Skechers is my favorite brand in sandels, slip-on shoes
They look very comfy all though I'm going to break them in slowly because the straps seem very tight !
Great shoes! Hold up well. Only problem, I keep getting rocks in the shoes, so not a great choice for hiking. But, great for the beach (i.e. getting wet) or whatever!
Pleased and what was expected. Would have gave 5 stars but there was a spot on the right shoe but not worth the hassel of sending them back
good
Great shoes, love Skechers
Nice and light. I did not feel they were good work shoes for someone who is on their feet a lot.
What a great pair of shoes. These skechers run true to size. Although I do have a pretty narrow foot and if your foot runs wider than most,you might want to go up a half size. Detail and colors shown are true to description and information given. They are light on your foot and they don't feel &#34;heavy&#34; on your feet at all. They really do have great breathe ability. I love wearing these shoes because they look sharp and feel great! It's as if you are walking on a cloud and they breathe well and keep your feet cool. A must for any &#34;busy&#34; gal!
Nice shoes!
Thank you!
I like these shoes they fit well and look great.
Real happy with these shoes! Nice casual look and easy wear!
i love this shoe. its light and comfortable shoe.
If I ordered again I would need a wider shoe . I do like the shoe . Delevery was very good .
I have owned Skechers before, so I trusted this purchase and I continue to do so after buying these.  I've owned and worn these shoes for months now and they are as comfortable today as they were when I first got them.<br />I have a narrow foot (AA) and they stay on my foot as long as I don't attempt to do any major running.  No breakdown of the back or sides after MANY uses.  I can wear these all day without any foot discomfort and have actually done so many times since their purchase.<br />They always seem to cost more than they should, but I am always so happy with them that I succumb and purchase again.
in the summer I think will fit better--somewhat large but 8 1/2 would have been too small--one review helped me know to get size 9
I am not disappointed at all by these shoes. This pair replaces a pair I had worn through and I don't like laces so this is perfect for me.
Shoes are awesome and fit is perfect! Very happy!!!!
These are awesome. Comfortable. I get so many compliments on these shoes.
Love the shoes just a tad bit to small
Super cute
I absolutely love that they are so comfy! I walked around the mall for 5 hours and my feet were feeling great! And I get a ton of compliments
Colors stand out and are very comfortable. True to size or can get a half size up and still fits.
The heel of the shoe seem to feel short as if it doesn't come all the way up.
very good thanks
It tear off the first day that we used it
My two-year old wear these and get lots of compliments on them .They are super cute.
This was a gift for my 3 year old grand daughter. The material started to come apart from the top of the left shoe after one week. I wanted to return the shoes,  however she loves the shoes and wouldn't give them up. My pair was poorly made.
I love these shoes. Being multicolored, they match various outfits. They are comfortable as well. My daughter had never complained that her feet hurt. She loves these shoes. She even wears them around the house.
good
Excellent deal!
The feel like they are too low on my ankles versus my other skechers.
Have become cheaply made.  Back heel depth was very short.  Returned!  Want to have him look for new product Name. Last pair split on side.
i bought these shoes for walking. i walk 3 miles every morning and the day i got them i went for a walk and they felt great. the bottoms are thin and you feel the road under foot and it was better walking in the grass and dirt than on the asphalt. these shoes fit to size and look great. i dont generally buy anything made in china so i have my doubts as to how long they will last. the usa made shoes i normally buy were so far off in the sizing i had to send them back 3 times. so far im very pleased with these shoes,for some reason the brown shoes were much cheaper than the 2 other colors.great for me as i really liked the brown. im glad someone is still making a sport shoe that isnt in some neon color or patent leather.if the shoe was made in usa i would give it 5 stars.i still have to be shown that a made in china product will last and be worth the cost.with the steep mark down on this shoe it was worth the gamble,we will see if the shoe lasts.
Exactly what I expected
&#34;OK&#34;
Excellent.
Love Love Love  Skechers, wear to work all day and they are very comfortable. Fix is excellent. Arrived when promised. Great seller.
It fits fine.
wonderful shoe
I am very satisfied because they fit perfect, they are very comfortable and they arrived quicker than I expected. Thank you!!
I have worn Skechers for over 10 years.  Great bounce for working on concrete- linoleum floors.<br />Ive always worn an 8 M.  But these were easily a size too small.<br />Bought a different pair direct from Skechers and I'm on my feet again.
Hard to find all white shoes... These will do the job!
Love these shoes, but they must be discontinued...  :(
GREAT SNEAKER
so comfy and stylish
excelent
Great for walking on the treadmill, better price than the new balance. I'm thinking of getting another pair for daily use.
I had ordered them a little wide the last pair of these i bought lasted 3 years
Its made from a very strong leather it hearts my taos wearing them the first time maybe not 10.5 100%
Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping AAAAAAA+++++++++
Can never go wrong with Sketchers.
I live in these shoes when I'm home and also for shopping.  Great support, very comfortable
Skechers are the best fitting sneakers for me, and the Energy Orbit mules are by far my ffavorite!! When I have bought them, I have gotten them 3 pair at a time! I never wanted to be without them and generally didnâ€™t wear them longer than 6 months before changing to a new pair. I know that shoes/sneakers wear out inside as well as outside, and I like to treat my feet like they are my best friends! I know that if I treat them well, they will treat me likewise. Iâ€™m in my last pair and am sad to say that I canâ€™t find them anywhere! I canâ€™t believe that Skechers would stop making these great sneakers! If thatâ€™s not the case, why isnâ€™t Amazon stocking them?
These shoes are a perfect fit for my husband and look great!  They are like a 2E width and not the 4E they have an abundance of.  2E is the right width for him.  I ordered two pair of different shoes and one came in a 4E so we have to mail them back.  On the ordering form it gave me choices but we didn't receive what I ordered.  This white pair was right though.
really nice shoe, i wear 7 1/2 and ordered that, they fit great.
I love these shoes! These are definitely the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I could have worn an 8, but I have wide feet, so I chose to wear an 8.5 and they fit great!
They are a great fit with lots of comfort.
Delivered way before than expected A+ on the seller because of that. The fitting on this shoes is amazing I wear 7.5 ordered 7.5 and they fit perfectly and walking on them is a dream worth every penny and cheaper than other brands and more comfortable, definitely a keeper.
Super comfortable with soft memory foam inside.  I can wear these all day because they are so lite.
A little bigger than a normal ten but the extra room is great.
Not as comfortable as other pairs of sketchers that I have but still a good shoe for the treadmill.......
bought these on sale even with shipping where less than 30 bucks, make good yard shoes
My daughter now has three pairs of these shoes in three different colors. She claims they are THE best running, walking, standing shoe EVER and were INSTANTLY her favorite shoes of all time. No break-in period, just instant cushioned comfort.
nice
So comfy
i loved
The velcro on these shoes was terrible! It was constantly coming undone and my son would just run right out of his shoes. He stopped wanting to wear them - he preferred his worn out, hole-in-the-toe shoes over these just because he couldn't keep them on.
These shoes are easy for my son to put on.  He seems to enjoy wearing them, too.
Love all four of my pairs of Skechers shoes.
These shoes are amazingly comfortable, I am a teacher and I can wear them all day, walking, running, going up and down stairs... I walked around DC on a trip and they were wonderful. They are super light weight and I've never had shoes so cushiony.
Returned
The shoes were very pretty but my wife walked right out of the shoe when she tried them on.  Way too loose a fit for her. We'll be returning them.
*ALERT ALERT ATTENTION---LADIES & GENTLEMEN.  {DO NOT BUY}  These things should not even be able to use the word {shoe}  Totally AWFULLLLLLLL.<br />US POST OFC is Totally making out.

The shoes were beautiful....great colors....They ran way too large.  I wish I could have used them but had to send them back.  The service was excellent though.  Sorry
I already wrote a review on this shoe purchase. The shoe arrived on time however I tried the shoe on right away, as I excited. I usually wear a size nine but I ordered an 81/2. The shoe was so big I couldn't even walk in them. I tried to fix this and get a replacement. Not only did they not have a replacement but I had to pay almost 13.00 dollars to return them! DO NOT BUY
This style seems to run a little larger than other Skechers I own. But they are lovely and feel good on my feet.
I love this shoe so much I purchased a pair for one of my students , however I am having to return them because they are too large.
These are so comfortable! I now have 3 pairs in different colors.
I love them, the color is perfect, they are just too big.  Skechers is using a stretchy fabric that makes it difficult to gauge what size a person should wear.  I need to return them, shoot!
Bought these shoes for a trip to Vegas. We walked for three days straight and these shoes were perfect! No feet, leg, or back pain. When I first put them on I thought they were too big but soon realized they just felt different because it feels like I'm not wearing shoes at all. Love these!
The most comfortable shoes...love them!
So large I thought I had ordered a men's shoe by mistake. No fuss return tho
I liked the shoes but they run really big. Had to return themðŸ˜Ÿ
Fits as if it's stretched out - too large.
Be sure to heed the warning of the fit being large.  I typically wear a 8.5 or 9.  I ordered a 9 - too big.  I re-ordered a 8.5 and it is still too big. They offer tremendous comfort so I am going for round three and ordering size 8.
I love the shoes just a little to big .
These are one of the most comfortable shoes I have.  They are lightweight with goid innersole support.
Very stylish. Dress up or down.
Very comfy. They run a little big.
Love them and they came<br />So quickly!! Feels like I'm walking on air
These shoes are wonderful even though they are a tad wide. I think the weave is what makes them a bit loose. The length is perfect for my size 10 foot. If they came in a size 12, my mom would buy out the store ;)
I love the cushy footbed and sole of Skechers GoWalk so was looking forward to a slightly dressier version. Ordered my regular size (10) for my slightly wide foot and they fit fine.  However, there is a raised piece at the ankle that rubs the skin. I tried putting a heel pad on it, but it was too thick and made my heels slip out when I walked.  A thinner strip of moleskin helped some, but I doubt I could wear these to walk all day like I can with the GoWalk shoes.<br /><br />This style is also somewhat shallower than GoWalk shoes though after walking in them a while, the memory foam compresses for a better fit and you can feel some arch support.
Fit perfect, feel great and look good
These I tried on but did not like them on at all on my foot, they fit okay but were too wide as well as not long enough just a weird style shoe, they look supper cute here but I was not very pleased with the over all shoe!
Please be aware. Great shoes, but the weave stretches out a bit.
on time and what I expected.
Extremely comfortable. I ordered 1/2 size smaller than normal - perfect fit.
good
hated the green shimmer!
Normally wear a size 7 with all my other skechers. Got a 6 for this, and it fits well. Toes in front might be a liiittle cramped but mostly okay. Definitely comfortable enough to wear for long hours.
It's so comfortable, runs a little large. Normally I wear size 10 but this Skechers fit 9.5. Love it , recommend it.
A bit large but I think the next size down would be to small so these are a bit sloppy feeling when I walk and they rub my heels.
Comfort wise, these shoes are perfect.  They are light and the memory foam makes it feel like you aren't wearing any shoes at all.<br />Size:  I usually wear a 8.5 wide or a 9 regular.  Reading other reviews about the sizing running big, I bought the regular 8.5.  They fit me perfectly (where as 8.5 in other Skechers Go Walk style shoes was too narrow/tight).<br />My only complaint is the color.  The picture of the &#34;bronze&#34; shoe makes it look tan and matte, however, in reality they are more gold  and very metalic/sparkly in the light.<br />I wish they had more color choices in this style.
I love, love, love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had on, including other Skechers. They're nothing less than perfect. Plus, you can wear them with any outfit (except, maybe sweats). They are stylish enough to wear to church and casual enough to wear with jeans or capris. And, they feel amazing...like you're walking on marshmallows!
I was going to exchange them for a smaller size but had a fall and sprained my foot and ankle and now im so glad i have these.
The best investment thus far!! I will purchase these in other colors.
retruned
These shoes are comfortable without socks on. The heels aren't quite high enough to keep the shoes on firmly with socks on.  At home I wear slippers so I couldn't answer the question about how long I could wear these shoes comfortably.  I probably could ear them all day, but have only had them for a week and haven't had to be out all day since receiving them.  They seem to be well made.  I like Sketchers in general.
Had to order a size up. These run small. Great comfortable shoe
These shoes are fabulous! I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. Very, very light, fit perfectly, and super cute! They arrived quickly and nicely packaged.
These are very comfortable shoes!  On my feet most of the day and my feet are not overly tired by end of the day.  I have to wear thinner socks with these, like slack stockings, but no problem for me.  I think the cushion insole is the reason thinner socks are needed.
Looked nice but were too tight for size.
beautiful shoes but found them to be too narrow, i wear 11 wide
I get alot of compliments when I wear these shoes because the &#34;hot pink&#34; which is nearly florescent really stands out and compliments the navy blue color very well.  When I put my feet into these shoes, you can almost hear them give an audible sigh of ecstasy as the memory foam is definitely comfortable.  So why only 3 stars?<br /><br />Durability.  I have been wearing these shoes for just over two months now.  I noticed within the first 3-4 weeks that the sole was already beginning to wear down.  It is especially noticeable under the ball of the foot where the tread is completely gone. (see picture) Also, the pink  color between the sole and navy material is pealing or wearing off.  I don't do alot of walking or hard labor while wearing these shoes.  the only real outside work I've done wearing them is mowing the lawn a couple of times.  They should look nearly new, but they don't.<br /><br />I occasionally exercise inside by walking laps in a large room with low pile carpeted.  I tried to do this wearing these shoes and found that after just 15-20 minutes, the balls of my feet hurt so bad that I had to remove the shoes and continue walking in my socks.  Not only did the memory foam fail to provide any cushioning for my feet, but these shoes actually caused extreme discomfort for this type of use.<br /><br />To sum it up, the shoes are nice looking and comfortable as long as you only wear them for minimal activity.  If you are looking for a shoe that will be comfortable for spending alot of time on your feet or for exorcizing, I would recommend that you find another option.<br /><br />(I did not purchased these shoes from Amazon but from a local store on clearance sale.)<br />(Please note that I do like the Sketchers brand and my previous pair, which did not have memory foam or pretty colors, lasted several years, so it may just be problem with this model.)
They fit well and are very comfortable
i love this shoes
My son loves them!
Very comfortable.  I've been wearing Sketchers for years.  I've rarely seen Sketchers work shoes in stores, and I've been leery of ordering shoes online.  I'm glad I finally did, this is the most comfortable pair of steel toed shoes I've owned.
nice product, wait to see how they hold up with usage.
I need a shoe better then a sneaker, something more durable over stone and good support when climbing in and out of a truck and up and down from fork lifts. Thought I would need a few days/weeks to break these shoes in so I brought the sneakers along to change when my feet couldn't take it any longer. Put these shoes on and didn't need to change to sneakers at all. Very comfortable, good fit. Good price, too. Extra pair of brown laces included.
I would recommend these boots for anyone working all day on concrete floors.  I bought another pair so I can swap out every other day.
the second day putting shoes on the grommet pulled out on left shoe. The left shoe cannot be tied tight..
Bought them for our manufacturing staff.  They are happy and love the fit.
Great work shoe
The shoe is heavy and fit a little small, the foot padding was very thin. I am on my feet all day and need a good thick pad. Not a good buy for the name and price for me, i sent back
comfort was ok but still buying an insole to put in them
thank you
These shoes are very comfortable. I walk on concrete all day 8 hours. They are great!!!!
Not wide enough. I will be returning them.  Sorry
They are steel tow, so be warned.  They only &#34;break in&#34;, but so far.
great product
Value for money.
I want to thank Amozon for making these shoes  available ,they are the best work shoe and most confortable I have ever purchased ,try em out you will not be disappointed .
Great shoes. Very comfortable.great work shoe.
After a few months they are still holding up well. Took a while to get used to driving my manual-trans 20 year old civic with them, as the soles are pretty wide and tall. size 13 extra wide!  Great stability on uneven ground. Will recommend them.  Update..Toe blew out on one of them lasted just 5 months. Time to try another brand or style.
Best work shoes I've worn in several years
Durability is a 5 star<br />They are a little wide.<br />They are heavier than I expected but I guess that's the drawback due to how rugged these work shoes are made.
Using for work on trucking docks. Comfortable and look decent.
These are great shoes. My third pair over the years. Safety compliant.
for nonslip steel toe shoes, if u gotta wear them, these are pretty good.
There's a hard spot by the big toe on both shoes I hope over time they were in by the end of the day my toes are killing me
very comfortable pair of shoes. You can basicalkly wear this thing al day long
Does not fit my wide foot
Great deal on these shoes. I wear them for work and they are super. I love the no slip soles.
SHOES ARE VERY LIGHT BUT THEY WERE ALSO VERY STIFF AT FIRST.I'VE BEEN WEARING THEM FOR ABOUT 6 DAYS AND THEY STILL DON'T FEEL COMPLETELY BROKEN IN.<br />HOWEVER THEY SEEM TO BE GOOD SHOES AND I BOUGHT THEM ON A LIGHTING DEAL,SO THE PRICE WAS UNBEATABLE.<br />IF THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE MY FEET ACHEY I WILL PROBABLY REPLACE THE INSOLES AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Great sneaker and good price.  I did have to go down a 1/2 size and had to exchange my original size 7.5 for a size 7.  I was concerned they still wouldn't fit, but since there was a free return service, it was worth a try.  I have been looking for high-top black leather women's sneakers for many years now.  I either could not find them or they were too pricey.  These sneakers are great!  I can finally get rid of my old raggedy ones that I have been holding onto until I could find a replacement.
I love these shoes. I stand and walk on concrete all day and with these shoes having the memory foam inside they have made a huge difference! Thanks Sketchers for such a great product for working women!!!!
One of the least comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  I've had skechers before too and they were fantastic, but not these.  I travel a lot and walk through airports, in large cities, etc.  I am overweight so I'm hard on my feet, but these shoes time and time again ruined my day.  I gave up on them.<br /><br />Recommend avoiding these shoes.  Not really comfortable for long periods of time wearing them.
These sneakers, both of them, the bottom came apart from the top within a week.  They said they would take them back but did not!
These shoes lasted all of 5 weeks. The shoe started to separate from the sole on the inside near the big toes. I was surprised and disappointed because they are sketchers brand which I've used frequently in the past. Looking at other reviews with pictures of the same issue, I see I'm not the only one. I can no longer feel comfortable buying this brand of shoe anymore. I've only worn these 200 hours, I only used them for work and it was normal use. If you are considering buying these, save yourself money, time and aggravation. Look elsewhere. They will last long enough to make a return invalid.
These shoes were a big disappointment.  I wanted to comment on &#34;Fit as expected&#34; and the Web Site immediately recorded it as &#34;PRERFECTLY&#34; Fit as expected.  This is not the case!  Both shoes &#34;toe in&#34; severely with the right one even more noticeable.  I am uncertain if all Skechers  sneakers do this or if Amazon and/or its sellers are pushing Blemished or second line, outdated, products.  From another site I purchased winter &#34;duck boots&#34; from a seller who claimed they were also provided to the military.  It ended up the rubber was so old and rotted that a major split developed in the side of one of the boots which made them no longer waterproof and essentially useless.  When contacting both the Amazon Seller and the product manufacturer, I found there was no defect warranty covering the damage.
Great shoes
Great shoes and perfect for what I needed them for, however I wouldve ordered down a size. Typically a 7.5 - 8, depending on the shoe, the 8 were too large, so if you are an in between size, go with the smaller size.
I got them a little bit big cause I had some inserts from my other boots so when put them in they are a good fit but I haven't wore them yet because I am on vacation.
Great shoes for  those who are on their feet all day at work .
NICE
Would not wear anything else but Sketcher,Is there anymore of those available today March 2015?
Good product
Sent back
Delivery is faster than expected and shoe is exact fit
Bad
Good work boots pretty comfortable
They fit and look good. No problems
These are very nice work shoes, with steel toes.  Obviously, they're not meant for long hikes.
Very good and nice looking
Love tham fits great
after a couple days break in these are great. 3e width fits my feet well, and my feet breath better than my last boots
Very Nice safety wear
good work shoe...
Descent boot good price had a pair similar before wish the laces were secured with leather vrs nylon  but they should last a year as a welding boot
Good quality... ordered 3E, they are wide enough except for the front were the steel toe portion is, after a couple of hours on jobsite, the outer small toes hurt a bit.. but overall a good work shoe...they need to use wider steel toe portion for this size...
Great as a work boot. The lay of the tongue to the laces can allow stickers to pass into your socks, so I wouldn't suggest them if you work in such an environment.
After just two days of mostly ladder work, the black toe lining frayed.  Two days!  The top lace is a bad design and pinches causing pain, at least for me.
On time and High quality
very good solid shoe. Has done everything I asked of it. Just wish it were waterproof.
I like the shoes a lot as far as quality goes, but I do feel like my heel is supporting most of my weight, rather than my arch.<br />I should have ordered a half size larger, but because of the pricing structure I went cheap, hoping the size 10 would be long enough. they will be fine, just not with heavy socks. they'll probably be worn out by fall anyway, so that won't be an issue.<br />Getting back to the pricing: every size had a different price, and it would change daily, I'm not sure if it was based on stock available, or maybe they could tell what sizes were being looked at the most and adjusted prices accordingly, but when I go to a real store the priceis the price, no matter what size I want to buy, I buy the shoe that fits!
Real nice just right
Nice boot for the price, however, had to return it as there was not sufficient padding to prohibit the steel toe from digging into my foot which proved to be unacceptable.
Great work shoe for the price
3 pairs for $127 is a smooking deal for a great work boot
Very nice.
It looks awesome! But it's toÃ³ large for me... I'm 10.5 usually but this I think 10 or maybe 9.5 must be enougth
These, as with most new shoes, took a week or two to break in. After that they have been great. I like the steel toe. These are my work shoes. I don't worry about having my toes crushed by thousand pound consoles rolling over my foot. I will purchase another pair.
Similar to Skechers I had before. very comfortable for steel toe. Previous pair lasted a long time.
I like them, wanted a longer shoe to not push on my hammer toe
Good safety shoes for a good price.
They're perfectly fine for work.  I'm happy with them and would buy them again.
Had these for about 6 months now, had to replace the laces because they frayed. My feet stink and these shoes do not breathe too well so it doesnt help my stinky feet. My stinky feet make my wife mad which makes me sad.
Getting really hard to find, but they are so comfortable and wear really well.
I purchased wide width and they where still too narrow. They only lasted 4 months with moderate shop use. Soles wore out, uppers ripped, and inside support collapsed. Typical foreign made crap shoes. Don't waste your money.
lasted 2 months very cheaply made but not amazons fault
Great work shoe. Very comfortable and supportive. Can wear all day with no problems.
Very good
I didn't expect much since they're work shoes but lord have mercy are these shoes comfortable!<br />Feels like I'm walking on a pillow with every step.<br />I kinda stopped wearing my other shoes all together and I wear these full time now.<br />All in all a marvelous, glorious, balls deep, hard in the paint pair of shoes.
After four months the sole is taking off in both shoes and even them using in restaurant work
Fist year nursing student and had to have all white shoes. I bought the size 10 and the fit great. Very comfortable. I'll update later as to how they preform at a later date.
The shoe was a great fit. They started to fall apart in about 6 months at about 8 months I had to replace them. I only worked about 35 hours a week in a restaurant. I wish they had lasted me longer.
the cushion wears off in a week feels like you walking with out shoes after that
Fit and comfort seems adequate. The no slip traction is a bit lacking. I usually buy Shoes for Crews brand for the excellent no slip, but they wear out fast and lose a lot of cushion quick. Just can't find a good shoe that does both
awesome
Very light weight and comfy. Not nearly as tired and beat after working a shift.
Great quality I highly recomend
Very comfortable, the foot and back pain I usually suffer from didn't occur with these. Not super attractive, but they're for work, and they do a great job.
Reluctant to buy a pair of Skechers for all day wear as most have limited depth of the sole which leads me to believe they don't absorb as much shock as other shoes.  Have worn these two full days and so far, so good.  They have a good fit and are comfortable on the foot as well as comfortable to walk in.  They have an appropriate look to wear with my slacks and Polo or button up.  Certainly not a dress shoe but not just a sneaker either.  Time will tell how long they hold up but liking them right now.
I like the shoe from previous purchase of the same shoe but this time I ordered a black and a white pair of the size I wear and they were both a little shirt so I need to send them back and get the next size up.
My husband has a commercial floor cleaning business.40+ years in fact. I ask please that you look at the extenuating circumstances.  I met him n we were engaged almost 6yrs ago.

These shoes are a lot better than my last pair and help reduce a lot of the pain i was having in the sole of my foot due to capsulitis.  I would recommend theae shoes to anyone that has to be on their feet 8 hrs straight with no breaks for work
The shoes are great and comfy to wear. However, after wearing it 2-3x i began to hear a loud squeaky noise emanating from the right shoe. It basically never left and when i tried to return it they wouldn't take it back. So, i'm out $50.. which is not cool.
Good product
VERY GOOD PRICE OR DEAL.
Great shoes.
As some of the other reviews stated, it can take a few days to get used to the fit.  The shoe, at the back dug in to my ankle for the first couple of wearings, but after that, it became pliable enough to where I no longer notice it.  Other than that, the shoe provides lots of support, and is comfortable to wear and walk around in.
Excellent skid resistant work shoe.
The best work shoes I've ever used. So good I even bought a second pair after the first wore out! Even after all day, and overtime, my feet felt fine. Slightly achey but that was just from being on my feet all day. These shoes are extremely comfortable with EXCELLENT arch and heel support. Highly recommended!
I bought these for my husband. He said they fit well and are comfortable. The only thing he wished was better was the support on the inside. He said it's rather thin, and working on his feet all day needs good support. He will have to buy the insoles to add so he can wear these all day.
All is good if you have superglu to keep from coming apart
Great anti slip shoe
Great shoe
So uncomfortable!!! Can't wait to send back.
He loves them. He says they're perfect :)
I bought this shoe as my nursing school requires a white shoe. I saw good reviews about this product and am quite happy with the purchase. As some of the reviewers mentioned I did feel little discomfort at first. However, after two week it felt very comfortable. I wear it for the whole day and doesn't feel the usual pain after a long hours of standing and walking. If white wasn't a requirement, I would have opted for the black color.
It is my all day, everyday shoe.  I liked them well enough that I bought a second pair. I have been wearing them for about 9 months now.  The soles look almost brand new.  I kneel a lot with work and thus break down shoes quickly at the balls of my feet where my toes bend over.  There is some breakdown here, the only significant sign of wear.  This damage is less than I expect for a pair of shoes of this price range.<br /><br />One note, even when they were brand new, my feet got wet quickly when I was in wet conditions, walking through puddles, etc.
I purchased these for my brother as he works at Mc Donalds and is always on his feet in a very slick environment. These made a huge difference in reducing leg/back pain and he's not near as tired at the end of the day as he was before! I'll definitely be buying another pair when these wear out! He's wore them basically every day he's worked since purchased and they still look brand new! He tried another pair of &#34; slip resistant &#34; shoes and about fell as they didn't help at all! These work great and he said the don't even try to slip even in the greasiest parts of the kitchen. If your looking for an affordable pair of slip resistant shoes, Look no further as this is a great choice!
Wear it daily during work.  On feet during tour.  Very comfortable.
Real comfortable shoes, very happy with them.
Good shoes. I am a server in a busy restaurant and I am on my feet for many hours running around 5 days a week. At first I thought they were a little tight but they break in nicely if you give them a chance. This is a good price for these shoes compared to the store. They are not really pretty but the are comfortable and that is way more important to me when it comes to a work shoe.  Only complaint is feet don't breathe too well in this shoe. But overall I am super satisfied and will stick with this kind of shoe!!!
Pros: These shoes replaced a different brand of non-slip shoes purchased through my employer.  They were comfortable immediately and stayed that way, wearing them daily.  These are the first pair purchased in a while that fit properly for the size I ordered. I use a custom support device that I move from shoe to shoe, so I can't comment on the arch support.  The non-slip properties were as good as the shoes this pair replaced.<br />Cons:  The laces thread directly through the leather, without eyelets.  While this keeps them tight after adjustment, it also makes it difficult to unlace them to remove the shoes. Tightening the laces each day is difficult, requiring pulling the laces at each attachment from toe to top in sequence.  Attempting to pull the laces tight without observing the sequence resulted in pulling the lace through the leather, ruining the shoe within three weeks.<br />I would have given one star but I realize part of the problem is my own impatience, unwilling to invest the full 2-3 minutes per shoe to finish getting ready for work.
It's ok.
It was a bit narrow, but after a few hours of wearing them they became . Only negative i find so far is the insole. It was very uncomfortable when i just started wearing them.
Perfect for the restaurant worker who needs to be on his feet all day. Fantastic shoes for the price. Shipping was very fast and delivered quickly. Only minor gripe was that the box seemed a little beaten up, but regardless you never need the shoe box unless you plan on putting stuff in them after you get the shoes.
Wear them for 10-12 hour stretches at work. Feet feel great and the slip proof helps
Very fast service.  We were very impressed.
I buy this brand every year as part of my work uniform.  I'm on my feet all day on a concrete floor and this shoe works the best for me.
I have purchased these shoes 4 times in the post 3 years. II bought the same size and color as well all 4 times. work in retail. I put a lot of wear on my shoes.<br /><br />Now in my previous 3 purchases, the shoes were comfortable. They were durable. The fit as expected. They were not too tight, the width was as expected. The only negative was after a few months of wearing them 5 times a week for 8 hours a day, i'd have to get a new insoles.<br /><br />My most recent purchase made rate this shoe 2 stars instead of 5. As soon as I put on the shoes, they felt tight. They felt like a different shoe than my previous purchases. This was a negative for me based on my previous experiece with the shoes. I figured I'd break the shoes in. So after wearing them to work, a pain started to develop on my left ankle, right where the top of the shoe meets my ankle. Over wearing the several more times, the pain got worse and worse. This past week, the pain got even worse. The shoe actually caused my ankle to swell up. So i decided to return the shoes. I figured they were defective.
I use these while working as a Barista. My other shoes were hurting my back and causing me to slip in kitchen. The Skechers provide the comfort and safety I seek.
Not always the most slip-resistant, might consider another brand when considering slip-resistance
comfortable,but not durable<br />adhesive failure after just two weeks!
What I expected based off the positive reviews.
they ARE a bit slippery the first few days, but that goes away as you break them it.<br /><br />for me they are a bit too narrow in the toe section but its the best I can find so whatevs. but because of that the seams have begun to give way.
These shoes are made with good materials, and  are put together well.  Their resistance is very good.  The tongue of these shoes ,IMO, is poorly designed.  There is a lot room for it to move ( left/right and up/down), and if you don't position it just right, it can cause discomfort to the front ankle and pain if it is worn for for an extended amount of time.  Tying the shoes tight increases the chance of a problem.
Still breaking them in, but they're  a keeper!  Hard to find all while athletic shoes.
good value, good fit
thank you
my 3rd pair, i wear them 9 hrs a day and my feet love them!
Fantastic
I bought these shoes for my son who is on his feet all day long working retail. They fit as expected and were really comfortable. My son did notice after a few months of wearing them that the cushiony feel of the insole seemed to have worn out but we got some new gel insoles and that did the trick. They still look really nice though after he's been wearing them to work daily.
Love it.
Nice shoe has held up well so far.
Comfortable. Long wearing. Plain, black sneaker-like, but can pass for casual dress shoe.
I'm about 6 months into my first pair of these shoes. I love 'em. The comfort level is awesome and these are the only pair I wear for work or play and just keeps getting better. I'm really rough on shoes and I wear these everyday all day and they are still going strong after 6 months. They're not in mint, like new condition of course, but they still look good enough to wear in casual settings after I hit them a few licks with some black leather conditioner. Previous shoes I have tried usually were falling apart in 3 or 4 months and had to be thrown out. This includes some that costs double what these do here on Amazon. Several times I have worn these shoes all day with them soak and wet which usually destroys other shoes I've had. Even at that, I can easily see at least 6 more months before I'll need another pair. I don't know how Skechers does it, but amazingly, these shoes don't stink to high heaven like normal sneakers do after a month or so. The shoe sizing is true to what I normally wear which is 11 WIDE, I do wish the WIDE sizes were more readily available here on Amazon though. I'm wanting to buy another pair now as a backup (since I know how good they are now) and I have to keep coming back and checking to try to catch my size in stock. I'm going to start looking at other outlets I suppose. I know if they stop making these, I'm gonna be very disappointed!!!
Super comfortable. Made walking around at work a breeze.
Item received one time. Will recommend to other people.
Great Price Fast Shipping Thanks!!!!
thank you
Great shoes for people on their feet
Great shoe for work.
These shoes r wonderful once you wear them in and it is a cool day. They do not breath at all so if it is hot or you have to walk around your feet may overheat, mine did. Also the tongue widens at the top in a &#34;Y&#34; shape and was thick on the ends. Uncomfortable till worn in.
This is my second pair of these for work. I walk all night at work and these help a lot. They are not as durable as I would like but I got 2 years out of the first pair. Take a shine well too! Wish they still made the black Walk Fit!
Very happy with them
It's to hard to wear
great shoes, fast shipping
Great comfy sole. Especially like leather pad over Achilles heel. I usually get blisters in this area. Not with this shoe! Great for work. Non slip sole works great on oily floors. Doesn't attract dirt like sneakers do.
2nd pair of these. Great shoe for good price. I like the non skid soles and they are solid white so doesn't mark up tile floors.
The shoes fit great and did not hurt my feet as bad as what other brands of shoes would have. Overall good pair of work shoes.
Was having alot of problems at work with foot and back pain, ordered these and they are great! They give great support and help with my foot pain, no more shoes for crews for me
Fits well. Will see how long it will last.
Happy with the purchase.
A must have for working the cart as a charge nurse. I can run higher and jump faster with these. Currently have one pair in use and two pair waiting in the wings.
I do suffer from plantar fasciitis, and also peripheral neuropathy, so I do have to use special shoes which can get very expensive with time, well, these shoes are the closest I can get to those special shoes, now keep in mind is only the shoes, I still do wear special insoles which they do last longer, so the shoes are good in that matter and I will keep buying them as long as I use my own insoles..<br />Update May 17/16: ok the first pair was great and that's why I gave 4 stars, but this pair even when is the same size it came smaller, the side of my feet totally hurts and just can't wear them all day, after 2-3 hours of walking on them the pain is just bad! I don't know why are they different, not buying them anymore for sure!
Very strong and comfortable. Lasted about a year or so. Only thing is after a while the plastic in the inner part of the shoes at the heel became exposed causing some discomfort but the shoes itself remained intact otherwise.
Have owned many pairs of this over the years from the local big box shoe store and they have stopped carrying this model for one reason or another. They are a great work shoe and hold up very well for the price point.
my husband likes these shoes
The shoe was narrow.  However it is still comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.  I made the mistake of wearing these shoes out of the box for a full day's work.  Since they were too narrow, the second half of the day was miserable.  However, now that I have broken them in some, I can wear them all day and they are comfortable enough.<br />They have made it though some real trials of terrain, mud, rain, puddles, etc and held up so far.  Though they are not as comfortable as other skechers shoes I've purchased, they are definitely more durable.
I feel like a feather at work. I'm just joking but these are great shoes.
OK shoe, meets my color needs. Needed wide, but Sketchers is no longer making them.
Nice
Amazing shoes. They have been wet multiple times and still are holding up just perfectly. I've never slipped or fallen wearing these shoes. Perfect for someone in the fast paced restaurant bussiness.
Great work Shoe !
Good buy for people standing on their feet all day!!!!!
Like the shoes very much
need more padding
GOOD SHOES TO WORK IN
I work in foodservice and these shoes are great.  They are about as comfortable as possible but still provide good support.  The skid resistance is very good as well.  I highly recommend them.
Love them no more achy feet or hurting joints
Tongue gets a little uncomfortable after 8+ hours, but I have only worn them 4 days so they may need to be used more to really tell.
I breaking them good.  My first pair of sketchers. They work good
Excellent skechers,  Very good price
Was disappointed with the shoes.  I purchased them to use when I umpire adult slow-pitch softball games where you spend several hours a day on grass and dirt.  I found the size and width a little small and narrow compared to Nike and New Balance which I have been using for many years.  Also, as this was identified as a work shoe (assuming that the worker would be standing a significant part of the shirft), I was expecting good arch support.  I found the arch support to be minimal and have purchased gel inserts to try to make up the difference.  I would not recommend this product at this price.  Purchasing one of the better brands at another $25 or so would pay off through the life of the shoe.
don't buy shoes where you can't try them on first. These are horrible fitting shoes. Don't breathe and very uncomfortable.
hubbly love em greatly wish wasnt so pricey and when you do buy em they go up in price so get smart order more than one  you wont be sorry thx deb
Good. I like them
Difficult to put on, even though I ordered a half size larger than normal.  Shoes have a rear tab that is too large making it hard to put on
The only shoes my husband can wear to work. Last much longer than Payless non slip, for only a few dollars more
Good fit comfortable and light sneaker
Good pair of shoes
Great all around on feet all day shoes.
Fit well and comfortable
I'm a mail carrier on my feet all day. These are great sneakers.
I got these because people raved how comfortable Skechers are. The standard D is for a fairly narrow foot. I always buy a half size up and D or 12 1/2 2E. The 13 D 3 days in are very tight at the top of the feet. On the other hand my legs and back feel great. I walk on hard floors all day. If i had 13 E i'd probably be 5 star happy. Not sure. I will update this if they break in and stop hurting.  UPDATE NOV 31. It took a month to break these in to the point I could wear them without my feet hurting with 55 dollar inserts. WIthin 4 months the fabric of the heal is worn down to plastic. I got less than 3 month of use out of 65 dollar work shoes. This is very poor value for cost compared to comprable Nike Monarch 4's and newblance walking or crosstraining shoes of similar looks.
I've had other Sketchers shoes and this one is just as good.  Amazon has sizes I cannot find elsewhere.
So far so good, work shoes don't last long so we will see how long they do.
Just notice not a lot of grip, I'm use to shoes for crew
Satisfied with the shoes.  Just as expected.  Great!
l blew out my arches in Iraq. So the arch support these shoes provide is excellent. I can walk around in these shoes all day and feel comfortable. I highly recommend both the seller and the product.
Shoes are great.
My wife loves them
They fit great and feel great. They say that the best shoes are the ones that you don't notice you are wearing. I love these
Good work shoe
Comfortable shoes.
for the money and width they are among the best kitchen shoes out there which is not really saying much
A very nice pair of work shoes that I've been wearing for 5 hours a day for just about half a year now.  Grippy soles for wet floors.<br /><br />Some reviewers complained that the shoes hurt and that was true with one of the shoes when I first got them.  The tongue would slip down or to the side and cause a lot of pain on the top of the foot.  However, this was easily solved by putting the laces through the little slits in the tongue to hold it in place.  Since then, they've been great.<br /><br />I don't know how good the arch support is, I bought some 3rd party supports I like the day I got them.
Seemed to size a bit small for a size 11 US D med. returned them requesting a size 11.5. Otherwise looked like a pretty good shoe.
Love these shoes!
Bought for my
returned item
great so far will see how they last
Good product
good shoes for all day
would NEVER buy.  very uncomfortable
I've worked pizza delivery service for 6 1/2 years, and tried many shoes for the job, as I am both running around a store, and running outside. I needed a shoe that was comfortable, not too heavy, and has great slip protection. This shoe, is all that and more. Aside from being just a LITTLE BIT TOO HEAVY, this is my ideal shoe...Where it falls to heavy in the weight catagory, it falls into a strong build design. The shoe doesnt look or feel like it will be coming apart anytime soon, and I've yet to slip ANYWHERE at work, which really gives me peace of mind when im trying to get things done. The no slip really works, and I am satisfied wearing these shoes for 8 hour shifts.  - The last shoes I used for the job<br />Asics venture 1 - 5* rating<br />Asics venture 3 - 2* rating<br />Sketchers nonslip - 5*********<br />have a nice day!
Use them at work I do a lot of walking between 10 buildings. The fit is perfect and there was no breaking in period for these wonderful shoes
Great shoes for standing 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week in a warehouse environment. Provide great support and comfort and help grip the floor to avoid slipping and falling.
These shoes are great for work! Highly recommended!
Great, comfortable shoes for all day standing in the workshop.
Tried them on hurt my feet no arch support so send them back  got refund
alittle snug on fit,,,,but will stretch
This is the second time I've ordered slip resistant shoes from SFC and the second time I've been burned. These shoes are NOT slip resistant! If you work in food service where your restaurant has all tile flooring, DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES. I was slipping and sliding around and nearly fell down multiple times. I got these because the reviews were really good and while they are comfortable, they fail in the one area I need them to excel in. I have worn SFC through all my years working in restaurants and only recently had quality issues with their shoes. Such a disappointment.
I have been working at a theme park for over a year and my first pair of shoes were worn out. After doing some research on Amazon, these shoes were the highest rated. For around $30, I thought I would give them a try, I wear a Men's 11. I ordered a  Men's 11.5 to be on the safe side, and it's a good thing I did. The shoes are on the narrow side, but after a week of being on my feet for eight hours in the sun, they were broken in. I have had these shoes for three months and they are pretty durable. I had to give them 4 stars because of the narrowness, but hey, if you need new work shoes that are slip resistant, buy a pair of these! Arch supports wouldn't hurt either, especially if you are on your feet all day.<br /><br />Follow UP:<br />At the time I bought these shoes, I was working outside. They held up well, however my feet got wet when it rained. Six months ago, I transferred to an indoor attraction, so I wasn't wearing them outside anymore. It has been over a year (February 2015--May 2016) and they are worn out. The left side of the right shoe by the front of my right foot is splitting open. My socks aren't visible yet. I am currently looking for a more water resistant pair of work shoes since the rainy season is approaching. But these shoes have served their purpose over the last year.
Good quality. The size corresponds to the specified. Comfortably seated on the leg. Beautiful.
I'm a 35 year old man, 6' 240lbs. I'm on my feet all day and by the end of the day I'm always in agony. THESE ABSOLUTELY HELP. The pain is still there but no where near as bad. I recommend.
Great works shoes i can wear them all day!
I wear these at work as a mechanic. Great work shoe. Can't beat Amazon's price
On my feet all day as a chef, and find these very comfortable and supportive. These are my second pair with the first pair still going strong after 2 years. Great non slip sole for kitchen. Can highly recommend them.
comfortable
comfortable and nice looking but not holding up terribly well as work shoes.
I don't think these shoes live up to the sketchers name not very comfortable with the tongue digging into my ankle and the extra flap by the heal is I guess for extra padding but instead is very annoying when trying to put your shoes on cause it don't stay put then while I was at work I slipped on wet floor and fell into a metal rack on in the dish area which caused several plastic drinking pictures to fall and break so needless to say these shoes aren't very non-slip I've found that shoes for crews and tread safe are much better. Overall OK shoes I wear everyday for work but always be careful when on wet floors.
good
Roughly 1/2 size smaller than other shoesby the same company. No toe vents so you shoe ends up moist and fragrant. Odd pad at heel prevents easy slide on.  I needed 1/2 size up from where i usually am
Will most likely buy again in the near future
I work in a warehouse all day and the Skechers Keystone Sneaker is one of the most comfortable work shoes I have worn. I am very hard on work shoes so hopefully they will last a long time because they are very comfortable.
Perfect
My husband works for the Post Office and is on his feet all day. He likes these shoes a lot. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the insole doesn't have much cushion. We had to buy some gel insoles.
I needed a new pair of shoes that were slip resistant and reliable since i work at a restaurant. These seemed fine but i could only wear them them for a few hours then it would hurt like crazy. they were too narrow for my feet.
Make my feet  little tiered and sore I work  night stocking in the grocery store I don't recomend this shoe
great deal
i like it
Have to send back
I love them they fit great they're so comfortable, i'm a bartender and at the end of a 14 hour shift my feet don't hurt
Nice shoes for walking and working!
my husband said they were the most comfortable work shoes he has ever had
Amazing working shoes, I use  them all day and they are very comfortable
Very comfortable , but a bit heavy
These shoes are better than my old pair, and I thought those were gods gift to earth as far as shoes go!
Perfect shoe for what I do and very comfortable. Highly rec these
These shoes are too narrow and I have to return them. I wear a 10EE or 10EEE. I can barely get my foot into this shoe and it is extremely tight.
These are a very reliable work shoe. This is my second pair and I stand on concrete every day. They held up well for more than 10 months being worn everyday. Couldn't wait to get the new ones. Great foot and back support. Thanks Sketcher for a great shoe.
Good quality
Little to small they hurt my feet
both the female and the female males pair I bought were way big
RETURNING FOR LARGER SIZE
Very comfortable i love it thanks
Great shoe!!!
Comfortable but wear and come apart fast.  About 2-3 month shoe if you are walking all day for work
Good shoe very sturdy for the kitchen
A bit heavy but they will save you feet from pain if your job requires standing for long hours they rub my pinky toe a little. There not as ugly as they seem.
They run small
Considering there is not such thing as comfortable kitchen shoes after 8 hours of hard work this shoes are not but at all.
Wow its like walking on two clouds and for a great price.  That's all I can say.
good
Good work shoesðŸ˜ƒ
Sale price makes a good shoe a better deal.
great shoes
Great item
I'm a satisfy customer<br />The sketchers fit perfect thank you
I am a sushi chef. I spend a lot of hours standing as other chefs. I normally wear 10.5 but I wear 11 when I work and these were 11 wide. After using about 3 months, I felt pain on my little toe, and I found a red bean sized callus on the toe. At first I wasn't sure what the cause was. Now, after 2 more months of trying a few different pairs of shoes, I know this pair was the problem. I have the pain only when I wear these and it seems there's something sticking out on inseam. This product had pretty good reviews and I relied on that, but unfortunately I got a wrong pair. I am just gonna have to throw them away.
Love them!
Comfortable. Practical.
Bought these for my husband for work.  He says they are very comfortable for long hours on his feet. We had purchased these in a store previously but they have stopped carrying them. Very happy to find them here!  They hold up much better than any other brand.
Fits just right gets the job done.
Muy bueno
I found out that I may have falling arches and the shoe gave me some support. My arch on the left foot adjusted to the shoe, but the right lip roles to the outside of the shoe, and irritates the top if my ankle, Other then this, the shoe is great. I can deal with the lip. After 10-12 hours my feet are still comfortable.
looks good
Don't do it!! Like walking on rocks. At first felt OK but buy second day walking was painful!!! Since I'm a bartender that's not good. I've talked w/ several bartenders that I know wear skechers and they all say the same thing. They can't wear skechers any longer. Skechers have changed. Not the cushy sole they once were. :-(
Shoes fit as expected and still comfortable after many hours of work.
I love my shoes there was not a break in time needed they just worked.
Perfect shoes!
Would be a 5 star rating, but the shoes squeak like no other on linoleum tile. Thought it might dissipate after a month or so of use, but they still squeak with every step. You can hear me coming from a mile away.
Very comfortable
No padding, these shoes felt like they were completely worn out the first day. Very uncomfortable, disappointed in the quality as I have had many Skechers  in the past.
A good shoes for those who are on their feet all day long
I wore a previous pair dailey standing all day.They &#34;wore out&#34; after about a year(meaning they no longer supported or felt as comfortable  as new shoes do)<br />Size is same as what I had before so no surprises there.
felt tight at first but they stretch out
I do clinicals at a hospital (12hrs) and my first days I would wear flat shoes, my feet were killing me halfway through the day. I bought these shoes and they are very comfortable, I can last all day and not complain about my feet hurting. I weigh 240lbs so you could just imagine the weight and pressure my feet have to bear. You can find this same comfort with any other shoe like Nike or New Balance, the reason I bought these was because I didn't have the time to look for specific work/black/slip-proof shoes and the price wasn't too bad as with any other brand you'd easily spend double! One thing I must say these shoes are a little bulky and heavy but I don't mind.
Purchased for work, very comfortable shoe
Better than other Skechers that I have had.
I wear these for gym shoes (weightlifting and aerobics) and they're great for that purpose.  There's no need to spend four or five times their price on specialty shoes when I'm not running miles.
Great shoes
Starting to show some wear sooner than I would have hoped. However other than that they are great, and it's hard to blame the shoe really. I'm a big guy so they put up with a lot of weight and use. I'd get them again.
great shoe.
They work just like shoes are supposed to work.
Uncomfortable tongue. Takes a little while to break them in. Non slip works great in restaurant kitchen.
Nice shoe, only 2 complaints shoe runs a little big and the shoes suffer from the tounge slipping to one side.
These replaced a pair of similarly styled New Balance non-slip shoes that started falling apart weeks after I started wearing them.<br /><br />These were comfortable out of the box, fit well (wide width for wide feet), and were cheap. They also look cheap, if you care about that. I'm  completely satisfied with them at the price point.
I have to say, this is the most comfortable and durable non slip shoe I have EVER worn.  They fit so nice and my feet don't hurt at the end of the day like they used to....I give this a 5 star!!!
Good for the price
The none slip is very impressive.  Initial feel of the show was odd but quickly broke in.
Nice shoes, fit great, comfortable
I work with hot ashalt ,it's been 6 weeks and there holding up extremely well
My normal size was toooo small. Barley got them on my left foot (smaller one) Plus there is no arch support and don't seem breathable which means smell. Compared to my $90 Merrill's , not worth trying. I can't believe people are saying they are comfortable as they insole is so thin.
Perfect for serving and bartending. Haven't fallen yet!
I have been using it for a week now, about 12 hours or more a day. So far I love it. I ll wait for a month and if it still feels comfortable like this I will order my second pair.
good shoes
The outer edge of both heel inserts are stiff and uncomfortable/painful. I used a seam ripper and removed them from the shoes so my son could wear them.
I had to send these back. Too narrow for my some what wide foot.
Good shoes, but not a great shoe for flat feet or planar facitis pain. Held orthotics well, but caused pronation in the other direction.
The are very comfortable.  Good for long standing.
great
first time for along time these skechers fit to true size for me.
I am on my feet all day by the time I get home my feet are killing me along with some back pain. I have worn these for about a few weeks just to make sure and so far I'm very happy .no more pain ther are very comfertable .they are slip resistant and do a good job I must say .<br />Will buy again and do recommend to any one working on your feet .
Very comfortable. This is my second pair.
Ok, but I would not buy them again.
Cheap materials. Nonexistent cushioning. Had to buy cushioned sole for inside of shoe. Gotten better quality for same price elsewhere. Would not buy again.
Very well made.  Extremely comfortable.  Great no slip sole.
Great pair of shoes and for a fantastic price! Some slip resistant shoes are slippery at first until you break them in for a week or two. These, I put right on and had no problems. They're comfortable and fit great. My only complaint is the tongue of the shoe. It's on the stiffer side, so it tends to mash against my upper ankle. It isn't something to take a start for. I'd definitely buy these again.
I was very pleased with my purchase...
Like...
Awesome my husband stands on his feet for 12 hours a day and he finally has a little relief ðŸ˜Œ
Upon receipt of these shoes I tried them on due to the uncomfortable feel of the Townforst.  I had to use a shoe horn to just barely get them on.  Have not worn them & will return them immediately!
I've been wearing Sketchers shoes for many years.I still wear a pair that I traveled through Europe in, in 2003! They simply hold up - [well, except for one pair that got wet and the finish peeled.] I am on my feet all day at work, and I find these to be the most comfortable uniform shoes around, and the price is great, too. This pair, however, seems just a bit shorter than my others, but not uncomfortably so.
For my son's j&#34;sob as a &#34;server&#34; - fit well and he is flat-footed.
Very good dea
Good quality.
Happy with them
Very Good!
Took me about two days of work (8+ hrs/day) to break them in.  Can't complain.
Pretty comfortable and affordable, great work shoe.
Fits well, comfortable and feels nice even after being on my feet for 8 straight hours of work. Will buy again after they wear out.
Excellent quality and service .
Good shoe. Great price. Quick delivery.
Excelente
They fit comfortable and feels good on your feet
My husband loved them for work, he works in a kitchen n the non slips are perfect!
Great work shoes, also sowed front toe for longer wear life
Husband loves them! Very comfortable!
Just got them, wore them on a walk to the coffee shop. Pretty comfortable so far.  Very solid sole on them.  And the price was reasonable. I should probably pay more for shoes I wear all the time. Maybe next time. For now, these seems like a solid value.
Comfortable and reasonably priced.  What more could I ask for?
The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I've worn them for a few weeks now and there's a part of the top of the shoe that digs into the top of your foot. You get used to it after a couple of hours, but it's still a little painful at first. Other than that, comfortable shoes that are indeed non-slip.
I love it!
NOT AS EXPECTED !!!!!! TOO SMALL  TO NARROW  ONE SCHOULD NOT BUY SHOES ON THE NET, THEY DID LOOK GOOD BUT THE REST  FOR GET ABOUT IT
I really like these shoes so far!!  I am on my feet for 12 hour shifts and other shoes would have me limping about half way through the day but not these.  I have put 60 hours or more so far on these shoes and my feet feel ok at the end of each shift.  The shoes fit just has expected and are comfortable.  I ordered the wide size cause I have flat feet and these fit perfect unlike other shoes.  Excellent shoe for the money!!!!!
Light weight, non slip work sneaker.  I wish they still made the Shape ups work sneakers.  Easily the most comfortable work shoe ever.
Have had several of these shoes in the past and they're the best work shoes I can find for my husband! He loves them and they are priced reasonably!
I always have trouble with shoes due to a bunion I have on my right foot so it is hard to find comfortable shoes for me. These shoes are not bad for a few hours but I wouldn't wear them all day. I am on my feet at work for 8 - 10 hours so for anyone in a similar situation, I would recommend other shoes. For anyone that would be wearing these for anything less, these may just suit your needs.
Love them and am completely satisfied
A+++
Nice shoe for the price
skechers our very comfortable and help my feet because I'M on my feet about six hours a day. I would recommend to everyone
My husband loves these shoes.  They do not even squeak.  He does deliveries and is on his feet a lot.  Thank you.
Very comfortable and supportive
Bought this for my husband. They are great and he where's them to work!
item was as described ,very happy with the purchase
excellent
feel great, plenty of sole for working on concrete surfaces all day long
Great shoes great fit and cheaper than our local store
Perfect for Work Men's Keystone Sneaker
These shoes run small compare to any other i have bought. they are shorter and narrower. I am wearing them, but have to leave the laces loose and they are still tight. Would not buy  again...
good
Its not bad at all
good
Excellent shoe especially in a work environment.
runs narrow, not as comfortable as thought
I like these shoes I'm in a kitchen all day long on my feet and they are very comfortable shoe. I also like that I don't slip on the grease that's on the floor in the kitchen
I highly recommend sketcher work shoes for anyone who is on their feet for ten hours or more
I gave the shoes a 3 star because they are hard to break in. I use my own personal arch supports.. They are more comfortable and easy on my feet, since I have to stand and walk all day. The shoes are a good fit and great looking.
This is my second pair of Skecher non-slip work sneaker. They are very comfortable working 10 hour days on cement floors, these are a must have!
Product as desire!!! In time!! Is good opcion bay in amazon, great deals, good prices, I feel enjoy use this market. Thanks for every thing. God Bless you.
Real comfortable shoes. Highly recommend for those that have to stand for a long time.
All around good shoe. I purposely ordered a little large so I could put gel inserts for cushion - so sizing of shoes are close. Comfortable. Cleans easily.
Fit good
I ordered the wide width and got them they fit just right.
I bought these shoes needing to replace my absolutely destroyed pair of shoes for work. I stand all day, but my feet are pretty normal and I have no foot problems so I figured these should do the trick. I picked them out for the price, the reviews, and they look very plain and simple which I really like.  first impressions before wearing them in were pretty good right away. They looked just as good as in the picture, and the quality of construction is right in line for what you would expect for a shoe in this price range. After wearing them around for a little while though some problems were really obvious. Keep in mind these could just be my specific pair, my feet, or my size (I wear a size 7).  First the toe space is narrow and stiff. Not near as bad as some others I have tried, and not bad enough to not wear them, but it is there. Second and this is the worst problem, is that parts of the bottom of the shoe are curved up and dig into the sides of my feet right around and behind the ball  of my foot. I tried but could not reposition anything or work the material to make it much better. Currently I have just been wearing thick socks and getting used to it and it is now tolerable.   The heel height should also be mentioned. I hate a really tall heel, they just feel really awkward to me, and this shoe has a very moderate height to it so that is a nice plus.  The non slip grip seems to help, but is not foolproof, I can still lose traction on wet surfaces but it is a lot better than my previous shoes.  The insole is really thin, and while not that uncomfortable I find this annoying because if you want to put in a new insole, you can't put in a thicker one without using up a lot of space in the shoe.  The shoes come with a little rubber non slip icon attached at the front which looks hideous. I didn't cut it off just in case I needed to return them, but I did replace the lace and took it off that way which I recommend.  The best thing I have to say about these shoes isthat the little cushion in the back is pretty nice. The heel is the most comfortable part of the shoe. I will almost certainly not buy these again but I would say give them a try if you destroy your shoes and will need to keep buying new ones. These are not that much, and you could end up liking them alot of they happen to fit you well.  Edit: I have been wearing these for months and they have broken in well. The problems with them causing discomfort have gone away over time and I am quite satisfied with them, I think they deserve 4 stars post break in. Unfortunately there is no way to skip the break in period.
for the money these are great work shoes<br />there really slip resistance.
My second order of these shoes for work. They are simi-casual, but work look good and are very comfortable.
If  you work on your feet 8-10 hours a day then these are your shoes. For the price you can buy two pairs and switch off every other day.
Might want to get a better insole for these, the one provided is not very sturdy.  Other than the insole all else is good.
Really nice shoes!  Comfortable and attractive boot/trainers..
Old man shoes.
I purchased these for my husband who delivers for FedEx.  They started falling apart within 2 weeks.  Fit nice, but not built to last.
This is my second pair of this exact shoe.  The first pair was bought locally and then this pair I bought online here.  The first pair seemed to be a bit more comfortable than the pair I bought online...and only the left shoe.  The right one seemed fine.  Probably just a fluke.  I've been wearing them for several weeks now (13 hours a day...on my feet) and they seem to be holding up just fine.  Grip is good on slick surfaces.  The left shoe has broken in and feels comfortable now.<br /><br />UPDATE!  Nearly a year later and these shoes are holding up just fine.  Well worth the $!<br /><br />2nd UPDATE!  I'm on my 3rd or 4th pair... this current pair is only 5 months old and they are falling apart.  It appears that their craftmanship and quality has degraded.  I can no longer recommend them.
Shoes will fall apart after a few months
it was too small and the size chart didn't provide the  accurate sizing.<br />I ordered 7 US which should be 40.5 Europe however it is 39.5 Europe!!
great shoe
Hubby loves
Great work shoes
These feel great on my feet after being on them all day.  My job requires me to be walking and standing all day and I have no complaints about these at all.  They are good in oily conditions too.  I ordered the wide because my feet tend to flatten out some during the day.  I would definitely buy again.
I don't know what happened?<br />These used to be so comfortable.  My new pair has zero arch support and the 2e wide that I ordered feels tight and makes my toes numb.<br />Cost cutting? Very disappointed.
The shoes hurt my feet almost immediately when I start my shift. Since I didn't wear them right away, so Amazon won't take them back so now I am stuck with shoes I can not wear.
bought for my father, he likes it very much, very comfortable.
Good value. Shipped quickly
Not what I was hoping for. The shoes took a full week to break in and fit correctly. Working 10 to 12 hour shifts on my feet. I found the break in period too long. Within 4 weeks the rear heel cup padding had disintegrated. At the 10 week mark the toe became unglued on both shoes.<br /> The non slip sole worked properly. The only good thing about this product.<br />If you are on a budget avoid these shoes!
I order these shoes 3 times a year.  They fit great.  I never have that breaking in period.  I work 12-14 hours a day...hence the need for new shoes every 4 months.  They are the only shoe I will buy.
if it wasn't for my neuropathy in my feet, I could wear them comfortable all day.
so far they are a good fit and support as i  expected they would. I will know more in the next couple of weeks as i only wear them when i work and i will be working more in the next couple of weeks,,,
Very well made shoe. A good purchase!
Size is fine but they fit too tight it will take awhile too break in.
Very clunky and uncomfortable. There are better work shoes out there for the price.
shoes did not last a couple of weeks, very weak and poorly built shoes
rubs my toes a little
I have footwear that feel more comfortable but the Skechers will last longer.
Bought these for my fiancee, and he loves them!
In a concession to middle age, I purchased shoes that I believed would be more comfortable, all day.  I was right.
great width, I need a shoe that is wide, the 9 EE was perfect for me, and the color is just right.
HAD TO RETURN NORMAL WIDTH SHOES AND EXCHANGED THEM FOR THE WIDE WIDTH AND THEY FIT PERFECT !!
This is a good work shoe and it has a sturdy build. Unfortunately, the arch support is less than ideal. I remedied that by inserting arch support inserts. I bought them because it was a Lightning Deal on Amazon and for that price I thought I would give them a try. It seems to be a good shoe but time will tell. I will update the review if these don't work out as well as expected.
After my other shoes that I usually buy got sold out when I looked to order them, I decided to give these ones a try and I like them even more! They are very comfortable I work on my feet all 8hrs and also walk outdoors daily with them and they feel great! Cant go wrong with Sketchers!
Hurts the ankle real bad but rest of shoe is fine
happy with this product but the only thing wrong with it after a couple of months, the seem on the front of shoe came apart. i had it fix in a shoe repair shop and them the other side came apart in the same way. would like too get sketchers attention to this matter.
Comfortable shoes, great fit. Love them.
This was my first on-line purchase of shoes and I was very satisfied with the results. In my line of work, I have to walk the daily equivalent of 2-3 miles along with constant squatting down and sliding around on a hard floor putting up items to the lower shelves. I usually go through a pair of shoes in a month or two with visible wear on the sides of the shoes within the first few days but so far these shoes show no wear on the sides.  The wide size has helped with the comfort and perhaps is why no wear is visible on the shoes as of yet. I will most likely get another pair of these when the time comes for a new set as so far it looks as though they will last longer than other shoes I've had in the past.  Update: After 4 months, the sides of the shoe are still fully attached to the sole and the sole isn't separating from the shoe which is a definite plus for me. My only issues are that they developed an annoying squeak when I walk and the inside padding near the heal is starting to fall apart. Other than that, they have held up much better than any other shoe I have had in quite some time. I had to take my rating down a star because of the squeaking but they are still pretty good shoes overall.  Update 2: After 6 months, the shoes are now showing definite signs of wear from the daily hard use I put them through but everything is still attached well and there are no signs of any separation of the soles from the uppers nor any signs of cracks in the sole. The squeak is still present off and on. I just ordered another pair of these same shoes so I have them for when the wear finally causes the current pair to fail. As I mentioned earlier, these shoes have held up extremely well with the daily hard use I put them through. I'm hoping to get at least another couple of months out of this current pair and based on how well they've held up so far, I think they'll make it.
I bought these shoes for my husband for work after reading all the great review on Amazon.  The shoes are a great buy, fit and price.
I owned these shoes for 6 months, and only used them for 4 of them. The inner seam on the toes both ripped out, allowing oils and water to get inside the shoe and to soak your feet. Very annoying if you're an hour into your 14 hour shift. Shoes were used for a month of light food service and 3 months of heavy food service. Would not buy again. Stick to Shoes for Crews.
10.5 seems like a 10
Fit great and are extremely comfortable.
Great restaurant shoes particularly for ankle support. However lacks arch support and slip resistance is a little sketchy
My husband loves  them. He likes the fact that they are light weight and comfortable.
I like these shoes, they have a wide sole for stability, and they don't look stupid at size 14. It's hard to find anything in size 14 US that doesn't look like a clown shoe. I ordered another pair as these ones are starting to fall apart, but I wear them to work in a kitchen, and then also everywhere else. Good shoe, decent slip resist, doesn't look stupid when huge
Very nice
Soles feel stiff. Bought Dr. Scholl cushion insoles , making for much more comfortable shoes.
I always go back to these shoes for support and I can wear them all day.
Best work shoes ever. I'm a coffee barista on my feet all day. I put some custom Dr. Scholl's inserts in them, and I experience no foot pain at all, even at the end of a nine-hour work shift.
I love them, Thank you
Purchased for my husband....perfect fit.....good price.....fast delivery
Nice shoes
Needed a pair of shoes that would take a beating and still be comfortable in all day wear-n-tear since I deliver for UPS. Different, cheaper brands seem to far apart on me after just a few weeks of wear. But this pair is already holding up a lot better then other previous shoes. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because on arrival, after inspecting the shoes I noticed the tip of the right shoe was separating from the sole. It appeared to be a manufacture mishap, (not stitch correctly) and I needed them the day they arrived for work so I wasn't able to return them for a different pair. I repaired it myself in 2 mins with super glue and you can't really notice it now. Still happy I purchased them and will probably purchase another pair.
fits well very comfortable
I bought these shoes for my Dad for work. He is a chef, and these shoes are great because they are slip resistant, which is very important for working in a kitchen (or medical setting). He is on his feet most of the day, and the shoes are comfortable. Overall, he is satisfied with the shoes. Skechers is a great and reliable brand, and this purchase did not let us down. The shoes are good quality.
They appear to be a great shoe for the price but as with any shoe time will show their durability.
I do replace the insert with my own.
Purchased July '14 and had to replace March '15. They did fit well and were comfortable. Slip resistance was excellent in a commercial kitchen setting. However they completely fell apart. The seems tore apart and the fabric in the arch ripped through. Better than some shoes in this price range but would still like to get more usage out of them. I'd recommend them to people who need a comfortable slip resistant shoe but do not need something extremely rugged.
The shoe is well built and feels comfortable, however, for me, it was much too large. The width is fine. I may have to order another one but one size smaller. After a few hours it becomes uncomfortable and I would have to take them off but I do like how they feel, There is just too much space for my feet.
Nice shoe at great price.
i like
I found the shoe to be a tad short, could have gone up a half size.  The extra wide width was great.  They are firmer than my Nikes and seem to have a &#34;break in&#34; period. I wear them everyday to work.
The sizing chart is confusing. There is a US, UK and European size on the size chart. The US size matches the size of the shoe, but the UK/European sizes do not. My old pair of shoes (not Sketchers), was a US size 8, but the UK/European size indicated on the old shoes was a US size 7 according to the chart on the website. I split the difference and got a US size 7.5. They fit, but my feet swell and the shoes become uncomfortable after about 4 hours (I stand for 8 hours at work).
I have purchased this work shoe for the past eight (8) years. Good work shoe if your on your feet all day, very comfortably.<br />JB, New Jersey
I have bought four or five pairs of is shoe and they the most comfortable shoe for work. Is last pair I bought the tongue goes sidewise after walking a bit , a think it was sowed incorrectly.
Quality seems good. Maybe I'm just too heavy but not enough support, my feet still ache during long shifts.
GREAT shoes!!
wore out to fast the top toe of shoe came apart
Comfortable reliable and truly slip resistant
I like them
Would buy again!
Best shoes ever.  This was my 3rd time being replacements of the same thing.  I really beat these shoes up and they take it! They will go a couple of years with the abuse I put them through before needing replacement.  Incredibly comfortable, and the slip resistant sole is great for riding my motorcycle.  UPDATE: This is my 4th time buying more of these.  I really beat these shoes up and they last me through all the abuse i dish out to them.  well made and comfortable.  I highly recommend!
My son is a chef and needed some new shoes. He wears size 91/2-10 Soni got him the 10 and he said they fit great. Said they are very comfortable
Shoes? Really
Perfect for what we ordered them for.
I was originally looking to replace another Skechers for work shoes that worked great for me. Could not find them in the proper width so I went with these. It took a couple of days to break them in - it was tough as the shoes are very rigid. I work in the food service industry and am on my feet 12 plus hours per day. After about a month of wearing them, I find them great for being sturdy and slip-resistant. I feel confident in that it would take a lot to slip and get in trouble with these shoes. However, they are not too forgiving and my feet are genuinely tired and sore at the end of the day. When the time comes to replace these, I will go back to the Skechers Keystone as those are a more comfortable shoe for all-day use.
I use these shoes for work in the automotive industry,They are great for oil conditions.
Brought them the same size after having other pairs of Sketchers and found them tight took sometime to break in and with shoes of this nature I would not expect to have to break them in
Good shoe for working and walking in all day. I put a different insole in that had a little more arch
These are the only shoes I will ever wear. I already bought another pair for back up. I will wear them till the company stops making them. They are true to size, comfortable, and seem durable.
Awesome work shoes, extremely comfortable and on my feet 9-10 hours a day!!!
Looks and fits nicely.  I think the sole is a bit hard, not cushion enough.
somewhat small
My husband loves these work shoes, first pair in 40 plus years he likes!!!!
Have bought before will buy again
As I have to wear orthotics in my shoes, they fit and feel very comfortable.
great shoes
Having bought these previously I Was looking forward to getting them.  These do not fit or feel like my old pair.  Heel is slightly higher and there is a less cushioning in them.  I can last maybe an hour in them before my feet get achy.  I won't buy these again. Time to find something else.<br />Posted by Glen, the husband.
Exactly what I expected.
Excellent fit...i am very happy with my new skechers. Very tough as a work shoe yet very comfortable .
Good shoes just not enough support like it's pestisesor.
The reviews said that they run a little narrow so I made sure I ordered my actual shoe and went with a wide as I need in &#34;most&#34; shoes I buy and the fit is great. I was a little disappointed in the sole cushion and I had to buy gels which made for a tight fit one the right foot at the laces until they broke in (about a week). I walk between 3 to 5 miles a day, everyday for work and it is usually sidewalk and outside construction site tours so I would claim these to be great indoor and outdoor shoes. Very please and will buy them again.
great fit great shoe can wear all day
Great price and fit, highly satisfied
good product will recommend
First day with these shoes my feet were killing me I believe it was because I had gone so long with crappy shoes with no support that my foot had to adjust to wearing good quality work shoes because the second day was amazing my feet were comfortable and supportive and even helped with the pain in my knees
Great work shoes, could wear all day.
These shoes can take a beating on concrete floors for 9 hours a day.  I highly recommend them for work in a retail environment because they are inexpensive (at 54 dollars a pair) and hold up well.
Fits length wise but too wide hurt my feet disappointed
Awkward to walk in. I could not adapt. Minimalists work much better for me.
My legs will never be the same again. I've had problems ever since I purchased these monstrosities. Save your health. Don't buy.
I love it
Great Price Fast Shipping Thanks!!!!
it is very good
Very good
Very comfortable shoes but the leather like side trim is a plastic skin that scratches and rips very easily making the shoes look tatty and worn.<br />But I still wear them every day.
THE worst sole ever..... track, track, track.......
These shoes looked great when they first arrived and my partner really liked them. The problem is that they are advertised as shoes for work, but they are simply not comfortable for those who will be on their feet for long periods of time. The shoes themselves aren't exactly too narrow, but the steel toe portion is considerably more narrow and causes foot pain. Also my partner wears these as station shoes at her paramedic job, so they don't exactly see to many harsh conditions, but they are sooooooo terribly scuffed up. The whole top of these shoes is peeling off like a cheap pleather couch. I can't imagine the type of &#34;work&#34; you would have to do to make these shoes a practical purchase. If you need steel toed shoes, you obviously are not going to be the easiest on shoes. If these were a little wider in the steel, and had a sturdier outside material then these might be worth the money.
Great
Bought another pair because my husband was so pleased at how well they were made
I bought these for my son who works on his feet. He said they are really comfortable.  And the price was great.
Nice shoe but received Wrong size:(
my fault should have ordered bigger size.
Horrible shoes , steel toe is too big for the size and shows through.<br />Best use - movie props - long shots only.<br />Worst<br />bad<br />look elsewhere !<br /><br />Don
Nice shoes for work, but a little hard.
I wear size 12 shoe and ordered 11's because it's says that they run big.<br />But these were way too big.<br />Steel toes made them really heavy.<br />Sent them back for a refund with no problems.
I work in aviation. 90% of my time is in a hangar and the other 10% out on a asphalt or concrete ramp area. The loafer style is very nice for being able to quickly remove my shoes before entering an executive aircraft. Tread grip is very good, even on smooth painted floors.
it doesn't like what i expected
I rarely buy shoes this cheap. I bought these for work since I do alot of residential construction. Though these shoes are cheap, they don't feel cheap. They are the most comfortable shoes I own and at a much cheaper price than my other shoes. Since they're black, they get dirty all the time. Just take a damp rag to them and they look good as new. I am extremely happy with this order and I recommend them to anyone who is looking for steel-toed shoes.<br /><br />NOTE: These are steel-toed shoes, they are made larger shoes so that the steel-toe doesn't crush your feet when you walk or kneel down. Order your usual size. If the heel slips and they feel &#34;too big&#34;, THAT'S FINE. Put a third party insole in the shoes and they will fit comfortably LIKE THEY SHOULD.
Good shoes  After 1 year of use in a food manufacturing environment, the sole literally fell off the shoe. Fell off. Wouldn't purchase again.
Fit well, they only took 2 days to break in.
They seem just a tad snug w thick socks, but nothing that bothers me after a few minutes. The steel toe coverage is large placed well so it doesn't bother when u wear it. Recommend.
Shoes comfortable except I can feel the steel on my right toe.
They are too small
My son liked these!
These were the wides I could find, but still too narrow in the toes.
Great work shoe, can't give it 5 stars because of price, but still affordable.
because they make no larger, I bought, wore and passed along to Goodwill.  My wide feet, or EXTRA wide did not like them.  Well made, normal sized feet, I would have not have reservatons recommending.
Very good
Great shoe, Nice quality
These shoes are actually very comfortable, however since I was sent the wrong shoes, I had ordered the steel toed version, I wore them for a week, and can no longer wear them at work, as we just switched to mandatory steel toes. I decided to keep these because my old shoes were shot, but now I can't use them at all. Should have followed my first instinct and sent them back and insisted they send the correct shoes that were ordered. 5 stars for the shoes, zero stars for Amazon employee incompetence in not being able to read a pick ticket.
Perfect !!
I bought these for my husband and he seems to like them so far. He has had to break them in as they were pretty stiff so he changes them out with another pair for now
My husbands feet were hurting from wearing steel toe boots so I searched for a more lightweight,comfortable steel toe shoe. They fit great and his feet haven't hurt since he started wearing them. He is on his feet all day at work on a concrete floor but now he comes home and leaves them on while he is working on car projects in the garage. It says a lot that he isn't immediately taking them off like he did with the boots. Good fit, lightweight and comfortable. Very pleased!
Great product and price.
Shoes are stiff and  uncomfortable, I have purchased Skechers products in the past and was very happy, this pair not so much. I am hoping they break in.
My husband wears these to work everyday. Great fit and quality for a really great price!
Generally satisfied.
These Skechers are great compromise between job site and office footwear.  The steel toes are a plus as I often visit our projects on mine sites.  After a month, the uppers and finish look like new and the soles show no wear.  They were comfortable after a day or two and have been my primary work shoe since.
Usually wear a 10.5, had to return for 11, should have known due to the steel toe. Other than that, these are great! I stand for 9-10 hrs a day on concrete, and these are just amazing. I put them on at 5am, and wear them until 10pm most days.
Sturdy but classy! My brother loves it for his security job.
My husband always wears sketchers in a 9.5 these fit perfect.
Total garbage!!  Bought these for our 12-year-old son for school uniform. That's all he uses them for...to stay inside at school, and within the FIRST day, one of the laces came apart because the plastic aglet fell apart.  Within two to three days, the black leather around the logo on the outside of the heel and across the entire front of the shoe over the steel toe had already scuffed down to a light grey color.  We had these shoes less than a week and we had to treat them with black shoe polish to avoid him getting in trouble for a uniform violation.  Would not buy Sketchers again for ANY of my three kids.
The steel toe portion bothered my husband's right smallest toe as this pair seemed to fit a little tighter than his last pair of sketchers.
The shoes are comfortable and attractive. I wear them to work and during the weekends. And, they are a great alternative to sneakers.
So far so good, they fit well and seem to be holding up well.
Just what I needed. Thanks
Too bad that they don't make this style anymore.
good shoe for the value.
Is a good shoes i need 1 more pair size 11 wide for send price thankou
Felt rubbing in small toe area. Returned.
Superb dress or going out shoes
Excellent item!....Received as described!....Would buy from again!.....A++++  :-)
These shoes are every bit as comfortable as the Rockports they replaced. The fit was a pretty standard size 11 (which is what I'd ordered), and they're pretty darn scuff resistant so far. I've always been hard on shoes, and over a few months of wear these are still looking almost brand new. The leather they're made from have a more pronounced grain than other oxfords I've owned, but I like the style.
They are size 7.5 I've been trying to break them in for a week, these are the most uncomfortable work shoes I've ever had not happy at all :(<br />couldn't return I have worn them hoping to break them in!!! Very unhappy with this purchase
Love the shoes.
Fits comfortably and a good price
Great pair of work shoe I ever own with great price.
Longer than a usual size 11
Arrived as expected.  I like the look.This is the 3rd pair of Sketchers I have ordered
Would buy again
Very well constructed, comfortable for work and easy to maintain.  One may need additional arch support or prescription orthotics to make these completely fitting. I'm happy with the price.
Its so comfortable that I put them on at 8am and took them off at 6pm with no aces or pain
Always happy with Skechers shoes.
Great fit and very comfortable. Terrific value!
I wear these all day, with insert. They are lightweight, but offer enough support for all day wear at work, where I am on my feet all day.
looks pretty good but after a few days I couldn't wear them anymore it was just to uncomfortable.
The shoes feel a bit larger than marked, but not enough to go down a full half size.  Additionally, after two weeks the shoes seems to be picking up scuffs and scratches quite easily.
Excellent buy.  A great work shoe.
These are very heavy duty.  They don't breathe well. But they are very comfortable and look nice with my work clothes
scuffed within the 1st 2 days
Nice shoes
Son wears them at work all day. Had to buy insoles but no other complaints.
Comfortable, good looking, durable.  Included insoles lasted about 5 months of heavy use before I had to replace them.
Very good for school days and uniforms.
for work are excelent, very tought shoes.
They where okay for about 30 work days .. I work at a restaurant (38-40 hrs w/k) then I take a 18 min walk home.. I'm 5'6 140lbs.. Good sole did hold up as of 5/15/15 other than that everything else was painful... Will I buy again no... I think I found a good pair hopefully these are the mother of all work non slips !!
great shoes
Purchased this to use as a work shoe at the fire station. It is OSHA compliant and a very comfortable shoe that looks good, holds up well and a good price. I would recommend this shoe.
I have to walk all day for my job - these are the only work shoes I would choose.  They're comfortable and don't wear out.
I'm a professional cook and I've been wearing these for a few years. I really like them.
I like it
Believe the hype.  These shoes are awesome.  Totally comfortable for a 16-hour shift on your feet.  Keeps your feet super dry.  Good traction.  Crazy durable.
Comfortable,  fit well, a little heavier than I'd like, but
Great shoes
I had to upgrade the insoles, but other wise the shoes are roomy and comfortable.
Iâ€™m disappointed in these shoes. I had several other pairs of sketcher alley cats that lasted me years. I bought these for a more formal look. the texture isn't very good looking.  The tops of the toe area had worn off after just a month. It looks like cardboard. I tried fixing with black shoe polish but it looks terrible. comfort is OK but nothing to write home about. I won't be buying another pair of these.
They fit pretty much as I wanted. I always put a gel insole in every new pair of shoes, so you might have a different experience.<br /> I really thought they were fantastic except that they scrape the back of my heels. I'm just a little disappointed because I really like these shoes. They look good and really are slip resistant. I really would have given 5 stars but my abrasions won't let me.
These nearly destroyed my heels at first, but I eventually wore them in after several months.
My husband love this shoes...they very comfortable..hubby have to be on his feet for hours n this shoes works wonder, they don't even hurt his feets...he loves them.
Finally, a pair of shoes of the right width and size ... with padded interior. Great
Not the best looking work shoe, but they get the job done.
none
These are great looking shoes for being work shoes. I wear these to work and my feet feel comfortable all day. These shoes also look great just for casual wear outside of work. I would definitely buy these again!
Excellent
love them
After five months, I'm disappointed in this purchase. Took a good look at them today and not only are they scuffed to hell, but the edges of the material are getting tattered. For an all day work shoe, my feet are sore at the end of the day and that's not being on my feet continuously. It scuffs quite easily. Both laces broke after a few months. $30 Tredsafe shoes don't scuff as easily and were oddly more comfortable than these $50+ Skechers. The only thing that seems to have fared well is the shoe sole.
i bought these for my father and he was so happy when they came and when they fit!
Excellent shoes
Among the best work shoes I have bought.  Having actual leather makes a world of a difference in having a long lasting and polishable shoe.  The insole is very comfortable, especially if you have a higher arch.  The heel support might be a bit much but overall very comfortable.  The anti slip works better than many others I have used.  My only complaint about the shoe is that the insole wears out pretty quickly.  I had to replace mine after about 8 weeks in order for these to remain comfortable.  Granted that is 50+ hours a week with a 210lb person, so they do hold up pretty well.  Overall a great work shoe at a great price, especially given the poor quality of most other shoes around this price point.
Yasss. I have been burned on work shoes before, most only lasting a month or two and showing wear after a week. They shrunk or grew and I was being ripped off. Not anymore! I got exactly what I asked for and needed with this purchase! When these shoes go bust, I will be buying from this group again.
I have re-bought this same pair for years, they provide excellent slip resistance and all day comfort.
ok
Great work shoe for Hospitality or Restaurant environment.  Very comfortable for all day wear at work, good quality workmanship.
Good shoes, comfortable, but wish they had a better finish and in other colors.
love it
Lasted the whole school year for my son.
Love the shoes~~~~~~
Decent shoes.
I work in an environment where I need to go into different areas like kitchens and other slippery areas and these have been great. They are very well made and should last a really long time. They are comfortable and I wear them daily 12 hours plus. Comparing these to other safety shoes these are a fantastic value many others are well over a hundred dollars. They also look good and are comfortable. If you are looking for a work shoe give these a shot. I usually wear a 10.5 I ordered the 11 and they are perfect.
not bad
They were to hard  for me have to send them back  I have delicate foot but  the shoes are fine
Great product and great price.
they felt a bit rough on the top edge of the shoe when I first put them on, but wore them a few times now and havent noticed any problem with that. seems study and keeps its shape well
they are a heavy looking shoe, a bit clunky.
I wear these shoes to work inside & outside my house. I will use them in the winter & fall & in the summer I will wear something lighter.These are comfortable & soft inside.
Good shoe for the money. Arch support could be better. Very satisfied with the purchase.
Good Work Shoes
Great shoe
excellent fit
ok
Didn't prove to be the shoe needed for day long wear
Makes a great present
So far so good. I wear these for work when I bartend. I work at a very fast pace restaurant so i'm moving around a lot. They come super stiff but hopefully they will loosen up. I will right a follow up.
I would buy these again, they are comfortable, great to wear at work and play!!!
Worst shoes ever
They appear to be long lasting and durable as well as good looking.
good looking and well made work shoe. Similar to a boot but easy as a shoe. Pants break well over the shoe.
Great
Nice slip on shoes.  Very comfortable. Look good too.  Using them for work around the house, but they could be worn in place of sneakers too.
Good work shoes. They're kinda hard, and required a little breaking in. But they are nice. If you have wide feet, maybe stay away. Might feet aren't duck wide, but did fit a little snug until I broke them in. Something to think about.
Great shoes for working in a kitchen being on your feet constantly. Great value for the price.
great
Great pair of work shoes.
good quality!
Very Good Quality
Can't beat this work shoe for the price..  I love em..
good
I should have gone a 1/2 size smaller.
Till now everything good slip resistant excellent only the first two days were a little bit uncomfortable but I'll buy them again
cheap and worth
Just five stars
Great shoes.  I've worn Rockports to work and the bottoms wear smooth in about two months.  The Reebok work sneaker lasts longer but the tops start to look really bad after just a few weeks.  These shoes take polish well and the bottoms are holding up pretty well.  They are mostly waterproof.  Walking through puddles and across wet floors all day isn't a problem.  I wouldn't trust them for standing in water.  I work in a saltwater environment and, so far, these shoes are holding up a lot better than most.  Fit is about true to size.  They will be a little stiff for a day or two but it's not unusual for a slip on or unbearable.
The quality and price are good. The design is not very fit my feet well, because the instep feel somewhat tight.
Asked for 13m, received ?  Too sall and too narrow.
price it is good, define it need more wide next time
My husband likes the shoes,however they are not totally slip resistant as decribed, so he is very disapointed about that. I got them for him for work, as he works in a resturant. They cannot be worn there without him being on guard for falling. So overall I wish I had not made this purchase, because he really needed work shoes.
Great boots!
These boots didn't even last me 3 mo 8 the work I do as a tire tech for loves
Very comfortable.
These shoes are very comfortable. I'm on my feet for 8-10hrs a day and me feet or knees don't hurt anymore like they used to  with shoes that I had before
Great shoe. If your a 9.5 shoe size order a 9.
Fits great!
good
Very comfortable compared to steel-toed boots and much lighter as well. These feel like tennis shoes and also have a slip resistant bottom.
Great for the price.
Shoes were fine --- just as expected --- just needed additional insoles, as most work shoes do.
These fit well and are good quality.
These shoes are comfortable , light weight . Still breaking them in but so far so good.
Very good for the price I got them for ( under $29 ). But they say they are ultra-lite. And I couldn't tell any difference in weight from these and my cheapo Brahma steel toe shoes from Walmart.
My husband actually lost a toe at work from a heavy cart rolling over his foot. He started to wear steel toed shoe but they were heavy to walk in. Then I found these work shoes and he loves these shoes and will be buying again! This is the first time I ordered them from amazon, love the price!!!
These shoes are perfect for work. Would recommend to others.
Worst work shoe I have ever wasted my money on!!! I am upset because it cannot be returned!!! After one month, the whole sole on the right shoe crumbled off of the shoe!!!!!!
Great Airline shoes, good quality.
Great shoe. I am somewhat skeptical of sketchers because they are hit or miss with me. These hit
Excelente
It's good.
i love the shoes but i can't wear steel toe working in restaurant all day its so heavy on my fit other than good shoes
When I look down on them, it looks like I'm wearing clown shoes.  They're really wider than I expected. But I guess I needed that  cause they are very comfortable. My feet are less sore after being on them all day.  The composite (steel) toe doesn't bother me. All in all I'm happy with my purchase.
Be sure to order a wider width than You would normally to allow for Compost Toe.
I was looking for a good work shoe for yard work (cutting tree limbs lifting heavy stuff) and protecting my toes. These are so comfortable, a little heavy but fit perfect
When I first put them on I was afraid that there was not enough arch support. As I wore them 12 hours and throughout the day the support was there and were very comfortable. (I just had to break them in.) I usually wear the 6&#34; boot version so I had to get used to the feel of the shoe not tied for support around the ankle. I would recommend them and I hope this description helps. I do not buy shoes on line but the price was incredible.
Fantastic pair of work shoes! Very comfortable and fits great. Can't beat the price tag!
Great price, good quality, good fit. Happy customer.
It's a nice shoe and it fits well except that the composite toe insert is narrower then the shoe and my pinky toe rubs against it making it uncomfortable to wear for any length of time.
I think it's a bit heavy.But it is still comfortable.
Just got them been walking around the house got the 10 1/2 size thinking might have gone with the 10.  The Sketchers I have now were 10 1/2 steel toe so I thought these would be the  same.  I'll were them at work tomorrow and see how comfy they will be. Can already tell thou I need to add jell insoles, not soft enough for my feet.
best work shoe ever .
Perfect fit and in great shape, thank you
Very good A little bit heavy
Too largeï¼Œtoo wide
Great! the quality of the shoe is very good,the design of the shoe is beautiful, I love it
Good!!!
good
This is the second pair I bought. 1st was my normal shoe size, and the composite toe was too small. Ordered this pair in the next size up, and the shoe is a bit big (but the toe is right).
Well it's been only a week wearing the Sketchers at work, I'm enjoying them so far.
Generally, Skechers are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.  Not so much with these steel toes, however.  Mostly, my disappointment came from their lack of durability, within 6 months the inner heal had torn out.
Excellent
Best safety toe shoe I have ever had. Feels great on concrete floor for 8 hour shifts. Would recommend to anyone. Plan on purchasing again when needed. Skechers is making their name!!
The shoes are very comfortable.  BUT the backing of the straps started to peel within a week of purchase.  For a pair of shoes in this price<br />range, I would expect better quality.  I've had to do some repair work on them because I worry that the straps might break.  Major implementation flaw.
Both boots had eyelets broken!
The shoes fit well and are comfortable.  The only issue I have is that the rubber soles are really squeaky on floors.
Hubby loves
bueno
excelente producto
This was a gift, size too large, but shoes are OK.
excellent
Great shoes. Great service!
I have had heel pain for months, after one week on these the pain is nearly gone. Walking on concrete floors does not hurt anymore. These shoes are great.
Love them! *****
These were just what we needed to help take pressure off toes while walking. Bonus was the shoes did some gait correcting too!
Amazing!!!!!!!!
Absolutely wonderful these shoes are the very ive ever owned i would recomend them to anybody i love em please i hope amazon never stops selling the because im sure when the time comes ill buy another pair.
Ordered the exact same size/width as my existing Shape-Ups.  Close, but no cigar.<br /><br />Not the same width as my existing.  Even bottom to bottom comparisons note it's not 1:1.  Nor did they feel as supportive as in the past, more of a spongy insert than the trampoline feel of the old (when they were new).
only ware shoe except to church fastS&H
Very comfortable and this version offers great traction working in an industrial environment.
Fast delivery very satisfied
Purchased for my husband who works on concrete everyday, who stands on his feet 8-10 hours a day.  He loves the feeling on air comfort that these shoes give him.  And that we can get for this price is a plus.  Thank you Amazon!
My husband has worn sketchers for years. Bought these as an alternative for the Shape-ups. Were a bit comparable but he feels they did not hold up as well.
great shoe
Great Item
Arch support ok. Not as comfortable as original sketched shape-ups
They were just too low at ankles
I'm on my feet a lot a work, and these seem to be good so far.  I suffer a high level of foot pain in the wrong shoes, and these definitely keep my feet pain-free.  That being said, they are not as comfortable as my Shape Ups (which are the gold standard for me--I don't care about the supposed extra exercise from Shape Ups.  They give me the support and cushion that I need for my poor feet!!)  The all black look of these shoes fits better with what I wear.  I like the added benefit of slip resistance.  Overall, a great shoe for the price.
product as expected
Light and comfortable. Inserted my custom orthotics (pulled their inner sole first) and off I went. Did 4 miles at about 4 MPH and enjoyed them thoroughly. Nice switch up between my MBT's, Sketchers Shape Ups, Ryns, and ExerSteps.
Well made, comfortable
Great for fallen arches!!
perfect fit and comfort right out  of the box
The arch support could have a little more support and maybe the soles could be softer.  I have a high arch which means I need a wide sized shoe and suffer from plantar fasciitis.  I really liked the old sketcher shape up shoes for men, that shoe I could wear all day and walk comfortably.  Very glad you decided to bring back the shape up shoe for men.
Good shoes if you are on your feet all day.
Worked as good as expected, have worn sketchers for years
Bottom is hard than old Shape Ups I miss them bad
Very good
I just received the product.I am employed in a job that requires me to stand (at least eight hours). I could not wait to try them,and surprisingly(!)when I got back home,my feet felt felt GREAT. Takes a little time too get used to.
good if you are on your feet all day
Used once twice just yet. But its being great for now. The size fitted perfectly
Great confort ,perfect fit.<br />Easy walking shoe.
They  fit really good
I have been having heel pain and these shoes really help relieve the pressure.
RETURNING FOR LARGER SIZE
I tried the shoes on and they fit great but I'm still under able to walk after my surgery but i think they will be awsome
Very satisfied with the product.
For much different than previous Skechers I have worn.
Nice shoes. Feet still hurt but after while I'm sure they will feel better
Feet, Knee, and stop hurting since I've been wearing these shoes. Great support and looks nice!!
It's so comfortable. Delivered on time it's expected.
lighter than the older shape-ups much better traction.
It would be 5 stars if it is not made in China, the material is there but workmanship and the quality always have a question mark.  At the price it is selling the company should have it made in a country more responsible for the environment and material being used
Sketchers Shape Ups are the only shoe that my  husband can wear for work.  He walks about 20 ro more miles a day on his job.  He loves them.
I love this shoe.  I was so glad you brougt these shoes back. I have a spastic walk. These are the only shoes that last me for a year. Very comfortable.  Great shoes.
I bought these shoes about a year ago. I wear them every day for work and I can say they are extremely comfortable.<br />The great grip in the wet is the most surprising feature. I may add that the soles seem to be pretty hard wearing. I'm a bug guy and over the year of daily wearing there is still little to no signs of wear.<br />I would definitely buy these shoes again - in fact I'm looking for a pair now so that I have a back-up pair.
i am working in a restaurant 6 days a week and all doubles, i was having so much problems before, i supose to change shoes every 4 months, i own this shoes for an year so far and i feel so comfortable and they look that they will last at least 5 years more!!! i would recomend it!!!!!
Ordered these shoes and received them May 5. Today is June 25th and sole of one of the shoes has begun to separate from the uppers. I'm very disappointed. Comfortable means nothing if the shoe falls apart. I've probably only worn them a dozen times but it's past the 30 day return period so I'm screwed...
These shoes arrived quickly and are very comfortable.  The only negative is that the lining behind the heel wore quickly.
These shoes are nice for work
Wore a week..<br />Cracked on both sides of shoes. It's too bad
shoes<br />Size large
feels good, looks awsome!
I got these for my husband who is a construction worker.  He can wear out boots within a matter of months.  These have been holding up extremely well.  He was skeptical about the memory foam foot bed and when he first tried them on, he wasn't sure he could get used to it.  However, he now LOVES them and says they are the most comfortable boots he has had (and we have purchased VERY expensive boots hoping they would last longer).  They look great too.  We will definitely be purchasing again.
Good boots, too big!
Perfect
Bought this for my brother, he loves them and say there very comfortable and better then he's other boots
Somewhat big
Fit well as expected.
Order at least a half a size smaller than what you would normally wear
A little bit big, shoe is very good, very satisfied with style
I love my boots the shoes fit good.
they look good but kinda small
Worn for a few days.  I stand a lot at my office and these boots were comfortable right out of the box.  I've owned Skechers casual shoes previously and was happy with those.  These boots have some extra padding on the insole that works nicely for me.  I would recommend to friends.  I bought these to be used primarily as motorcycle boots. Rode with them once and they will fit the bill.  I prefer the thinner soles and low heel.  We'll see how they do down the road, so to speak.
Nice shoes,I like it.
These are great boots, I'm on my feet all day as an auto tech....very sturdy and the anti slip sole is the key to safety,<br />They rec 1/2 size down when ordering your size normally I stayed with my reg size because I'd rather have more room then less ,there perfect I tie them tight and the quick eye loops at top are great...funny, not all boots have these ...
comfortable and very light great purchase for the price well worth it
Wear  11.5! Order a 12 its like a 13 on my foot. Very nice boot though. I bought again a 11 this time?
I stand on a concrete floor in a plating shop six days a week and the soals of my feet are hard as a rock and get ridiculously soar by lunch. Contemplating trying to get my money  back
Didn't really like it at all. Felt awkward on my feet
Very good work boot, takes a couple of days to break-in, but once that's done the boots are awesomely comfortable!!!
The above review is very accurate. I bought insoles at about 50% of the cost of the boots.  They are made very well. I wanted leather uppers and a tighter grid sole. I wandered back here as I was looking to buy a new pair of boots. That should say it all. I have been trying to figure out how to get these to fit well. I can not. I started looking for new boots about 3-4 weeks into wearing these. I switch these and my old boots hoping something will change.<br />I have loved everything I have purchased from Sketchers before these boots.<br />I gave a 1 star because of the materials.
Great fit and comfortable. Can't beat the price! Will be buying another pair for my husband to use while riding his motorcycle.
Can be worn somewhat comfortable for 7 - 8 hours. After that feet begin to ache. Roomy around the toes.
We love the Skechers brand of shoes, bought these for the husband to wear to work at the power plant,they are steel toed and comfortable with arch supports. So far so good he is still breaking them in though.
Fit as expected. The boots are comfortable and fairly light. Will see how they hold up over time.
The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the boots are not advertised as steel toe but when I got them they were. Other than that these are really good boots, extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend them.
Great boots.  Just remember, these have steel toes, after 9 hours I'm ready to get them off.
Very happy with the shoes. They are comfortable to wear all day.
You get what you pay for.. I work 8+ hours on my feet.. I wish the comfort last long then 45min!
They're definitely wide in the toe, but on the whole they're solid, comfortable shoes.<br /><br />I work in Project Management so I am only on the construction site 1-2 days a week.  For the price, this is a great shoe for when I am on site.  They're comfortable and sturdy.  However, they are a little big in the toe so I am walking around with more space than necessary.  If you're someone like me who isn't on site that much and when you are on site isn't doing a lot of manual labor, it's a reasonable shoe at a reasonable price and will work fine.  If you're someone who is on site everyday welding/laying pipe/ painting/ etc. I would recommend shelling out the extra $100 for a more comfortable, longer lasting pair of shoes.
Fit nice fairly lightweight good for the price
I wear them every day as a security officer.  They give good support and are very comfortable.
Bought these for my son to wear to his job.  Price was very reasonable compared to some other brands.  My son finds them very comfortable.
a Little bit unconfy, like heavy.
Perfect fit..
Great Memory foam. True to size.
Solid Work Boots.
Comfortable
A little heavy,but fit
I bought it for my boyfriend and he and I were pleasantly surprised. He said it looked great and fit very comfortably. He loved the steel toe! Came in perfect condition and packed very well. I'd buy it for him again. The price is excellent!
Super comfortable boot
Decent boots on a budger.
the boots did not come with a return sheet. I was unaware they are  steel toe, I need to exchange for regular toe. please email me a return sheet asap as I am anxious to start wearing them. thank you joe rachford  email: joeyracgford@yahoo.com
Good boots
Nice shoes that fit comfortably. Hopefully they last
I've been  getting troublesome calluses on my left foot wearing size 91/2w so I took a chance on these shoes at size 10. Today is first day wearing them, width is good but I may put insoles in them because I went up a half size. Comfortable so far without insoles.
Great product. Fit, finish and quality! Great shipping as always Amazon!
My husband loves how dry they keep his feet and how lightweight they are!
Very comfortable and seems like it is well made. I work in boots all of the time at work and have tried many different ones. These seem best so far.
These are great work boots.  I've worn mine for 10-12 hours a day for over one year now, and I have no complaints, especially considering the price.  I'll buy another pair if these ever wear out.
I'm a big guy, always a size 14 boot however these are just too large. Not only in size length wise but the interior room of the boot (top of the foot area) has more space than needed. I could easily put on 3 pairs of socks and still have room. The padding is stiff so be prepared to buy better insoles and a smaller size boot.
fit as expected.
Perfect!!!!!
narrow in  the toes
Perfect for work
Good job. Thank you.
Thought the insole was all memory foam.  it's not. Not very comfortable.
I like the design of the shoe, but the steel toe hurt my feet. the sole was also not that comfortable on me. Returned the next day
Love the shoes. They are comfortable for all day wear. A little frustrated they dropped considerably in price two days after I received them.
in the beginning i had trouble with it .It itched the back of my foot .But after two times its fine and it got comfortable. nice shoe for work in  place with lifting and dropping. Now I use it every day.
Ok
Well-made product. Materials seem more durable than comparable models from SFC.
Nice
I wear a 4E, and these are perfect! Super-comfortable, well-made, and stylish.
love the shoe. old school style with rugged work shoe durability.
Very satisfied
After a few months of wearing these, my feet hurt.. any other slip resistant shoe doesn't hurt this much after a 4 hour shift of work.
Fits perfect.  We will see how long they last. already tearing apart at the bottom 4/12/15 after a month.  Sketches are weak for the food industry.
No good... i dont recoment this shoe...<br />The sole start falling apart and i dont even used them that often
Good work shoes. Comfortable and sturdy.
I bought these shoes after my other shoes broke I bought from Walmart for 15 bucks and they lasted me 2 years!! After 3 months with these sketchers my feet started bruising and they back of my feet got cuts because the shoes broke inside. I do not recommend these at all save your money and go to Walmart.
These are the most stylish and most comfortable non slips I've ever owned. I've been waiting tables for about 4 years now and have gone through a dozen pairs of inferior products. I'll be buying these again if and when they get old.
First pair of Skecher work boots I've ever purchased and I love them!! Memory foam allows me to wear them all day! I work as an engineer so I'm walking all day and have had NO problems!
My husband found that shoes so comfortable, he ask for a half size smaller and I've ordered them.  The 10s were a little large, but wearing two pair of socks has enabled him to enjoy the first pair.  He wore them all day during a recent trip to Reno for Hot August Nights and realized the support and comfort helped his back and legs.
Nice what I was exspectinh
These shoes are well made. They started out comfortable and good fit but the more I wore them, the more I noticed that the &#34;relaxed&#34; is really relaxed. My feet started to move around a lot and slide from side to side.  I would not recommend these if you like a snug shoe. Other than this, the produce is quality leather. The produce arrived timely and well packaged. For the quality, the price is reasonable.  I won't be buying this &#34;relaxed&#34; fit shoe again but have bought other shoes from Skechers that fit good on my feet.
Very good shoes
Just the way I like it.3
I've been slacking off on my review of products. However, I want to highly recommend these Skecher's Work Boots. I own Timberland, Redwing, and other Skecher's boots. These Skecher's are one of the most comfortable and light workboots I own. I received these boots today, June 23, 2015. I put them on and immediately noticed a nice wide, but not too wide fit in my toe section. The anti skid and composite safety toe are light weight while offering protection. I was not asked to write a review, and I purchased these boots on a whim. Glad I did buy these boots. So will you. Highly recommended.
If I could give ZERO stars, I would gladly!!!<br />Just looked at receipt. Purchased these Jan 10, 2015. They started falling apart approximately 2 months ago. These are the worst workboots we have ever bought. Let alone, that my husband has ever worn. Months, my husband has been complaining of so much pain in both feet near his arches. The feeling of aches and burning. To the point that after a long day at work. Standing for 8 to 12 hrs a day, once home he would try and relax. He would get stabbing pains in his feet that if he were napping, it would wake him. I would rub his feet to try and make him feel better. But if I applied to much pressure to the area it would about send him through the roof. I have watched him get up after lying down, and he'd have to walk carefully as he could barely put weight on his feet. That is how horrible these boots made him feel. We had no idea the pain was caused by the boots. The only reason I bought him new Timberland Pro boss was because these were falling apart already. Since he has been wearing his new boots, his pain in the 4 workdays has pretty much disappeared.<br /><br />Sketchers, not only is the quality of these boots poorly made. They lack comfort. They LACK lots and lots of comfort. Which I am shocked. We actually do have other Sketchers footwear, but workboots will never be 1 of them again!
Good boots for the money!
They are good boots so far. Comfortable
Terrific product, grade &#34;A&#34;.  But, seller would earn an &#34;F&#34; grade. Casts a negative shadow on the rest of the Amazon Marketplace. Too bad!
A good shoe for the price
I'm having a foot problem that prevented me from wearing them too long. I like the shoes they feel good and supply a firm arch support.
Garbage quality fell apart after 1 week, they seem worse than all other sketchers products complete rip off.
My feet gets tired a lot during my work at the kitchen
on time, as advertized
these look and feel cheap. It feels like your wearing plastic shoes. they didn't fit right around my ankles so they flopped around like flip flops.
These are good shoes.  Well made and comfortable.  They can be cleaned up with soap and water.
Some what larger than expected but not uncomfortable. Satisfied with the quality of the shoe.
Great for work
The size I ordered was way too big. I wear size US 11 tennis shoes, so I ordered size 11 for these as well; practically fell into them. I returned them, but it cost me half of what I bought them for to pay for shipping them back! Not pleased with this transaction.
They where purchased for my husband, they are better than he expected. they arrived on time and the package was good
Half sizes would be great, but a quality shoe for the price.
My sketchers for work fit as expected. I like the make And the quality. Nice kicks.
My husband loves them
I have generally wide feet and these work fine.  Needed them for a cooking class.  Teacher approved.
Great shoes
stop using after 2 days.
Used to have them for years. Now all of a sudden size 11 is a whole inch bigger than my foot.
I wear a size 13 shoe in all my other shoes.  These were so ridiculously large that my wife called them &#34;flippers&#34; when she first saw them. I tried a size 12 by the same manufacturer and they were still too large.  So I finally tried a size 11, again by the same manufacturer and though they murdered my toes they refused to stay on my heels and continuously pulled my socks off my feet.  I believe this manufacturer misses the mark in sizing, but I appreciate greatly Amazon's no question asked return policy.
Good shoes just to big
Fit as expected, great shipping...durable
i bought 2 pair these shoes  and i work in the kitchen after two month the bottom started lifting they both serve me three months each they are no good they are total wast of time kmt
Cheap and comfortable
need to have a larger size
I like the shoes, but If you wear size 10 you need to get them at size 9 as they over time stretched into over size.. I have been wearing them for a period of time and what I find is that the bottom always lift off and need to be repaired.. the S sketcher logo...always fall off.
8 hour shift as a line cook wear real well!
Nice shoes for the price
Excellent work shoes, very comfortable .
Good shoes
Bought these because the Dawgs I usually buy were out of stock.   Unfortunately these shoes fit quite snug with a reasonable sock. As such, my feet start to hurt very quickly. I would suggest buying a size bigger to account of the narrow toe box. However, the other problem is that the shoes tend to act like &#34;flip flops&#34; when walking.   Overall, I am not happy with this shoe and will have to buy another.
Nice for the price.
Great and very comfy will buy another anyday
A litlle big
Sent them back
Good product! Thanks!
Good
Using them as slippers that can be used to run outside in. Have extremely high arches so wasn't expecting them to work for me, not many shoes do.<br />Like the fact that I can just slip them on and go, and they are water proof.
very comfortable
very good
OK for short-term yard use, but al who order should order a whole size larger - they're that short.
Did not fit
I work in the OR all day long, these shoes are perfect!!
These are great kitchen shoes, I work full time in a kitchen and these have been so nice for my feet. The one complaint that I have is that they take on a horrible smell....I've tried to clean them and it made it worse, but other than my stinky feet I'm happy with this purchase.
I would 9 wide.
Good work shoes for good price!
Good
My husband wears these on a daily basis. He says they are very comfortable and they're great for working around the yard and in his mechanical shop. A very good purchase!
Great work shoe. It breaths so it nice and comfortable for the type of work I do.
not as good as the dawgs.  the dogs hug your feel and wont slip out.  These will slip out
good
Good starter shoe
The best kitchen shoes I found for good price. Last about 10 months for me.
ok
Shoes seems well made, especially for the price point.  But I can't put them on.  Too tight.
It was good
I love Skechers shoes. I own many pairs. But this model seems to run larger. Too big and very loose
Got these in May 2014 for my boyfriend, who is a cook.  He'd been going through a cheap version of these from a local superstore, for about $25, once every 6 wks!  These have lasted well and the reason I'm back 10 mos later, he wanted to get another pair before the others wore out.  Great for kitchen work, they don't stain or soak up water...slip proof and the clog back has a little bit of a lip on it to keep them from slipping off.  I would note they do seem to run about 1/2 too small.  I would consider this especially if you are looking for a 1/2 size shoe, Definitely go UP.  Would obviously recommend and purchase again ( intend to soon ).
Great shoes, great fit. This is my second pair I have bought. Love them!
My husband has always had a pair of clogs to use outside in the yard. As the dog ate the last pair I tried these. Now he is spoiled. He loves these shoes and never wants me to buy him a different brand. He wears a size 12 and these fit perfectly. I know he really likes these as he makes sure they are out of puppy's reach.
Overall these are a good product. I would go a size smaller then normal. Might just be me though. For restaurant work they clean up very easily. Recommend strongly for kitchen staff.
Super comfortable! And light weight.
fits really well
Way too narrow.
The boots held up good for the first 6 or 7 weeks and for the last 3 weeks the wear on them have been disappointing. Sand and dirt has been getting underneath the sealed waterproofed insert and the boot itself. This should not happen to boots that are only 9 weeks old.
Although they were nice and sturdy looking boots out of the box, my experience with wearing them proved otherwise.  I normally wear a D width but decided to purchase the EW or extra wide width because of the composite toe.  I added a pair of Dr.Scholl's sole inserts for added comfort and support.  After my first 6-hour shift my toes were sore.  The next day the top lace hook on one of the boots broke off (they are made of plastic which is unacceptable for a boot at this price point) as I was tying my laces.  Since I had no other options, I had to use them another day without lacing them to the top and at the end of my 6-hour shift my feet felt even worse than the first day.  Needless to say, I returned these to Amazon for a refund.  Since I needed a pair of boots to work in immediately, I decided to purchase a pair of D width Herman Survivor composite toe work boots from Walmart for about $50.  I put the same Dr. Scholl's sole inserts in them and these boots proved to be a million times more comfortable than the Skechers.  In case anyone is interested in the one's I bought from Walmart they are called 'Herman Survivor Men's Irontrail Steel Toe Waterproof Work Boot' and even though Walmart describes them as having a 'Steel Toe' they actually have a composite toe.
It is hard to find good work boots.  I did not want to buy something online, but what I was finding in stores in the $100 range just wasn't right for me.  I took a shot with these and am pleasantly surprised.  My feet are wide!  These are not wide enough.  They aren't too tight, but the first place that they will give is at the widest part of my foot.<br /><br />These boots are also kind of clunky, big and thick, but the composite toe makes them not quite as heavy as steel toe.<br /><br />The best part about them is that they are comfortable!  The inside is soft and when I tie them tight there isn't any part that is really digging into my ankle or anything.
Good
Good boots. Have had several pair of the same before.
These were for my Hubby, and he Thinks they are great and he wears them all the time.
Expected something a little lighter in weight, not really an arch built into the shoe.  My feet get really hot in these things, not a summer shoe (which is what I was expecting).  My Alaska work boots from caterpillar are cooler on my feet than the skechers.  Am thinking of returning them, but I might save them for winter use.  They are comfortable (as far as the way they fit and feel) they are just too hot, which actually ends up in foot fatigue if I wear them for more than an hour or 2.  The extra wide width is a plus, sole is extra thick, and adds an inch or more to my height.  I guess the extra sole thickness could be considered a plus to someone who wished to be a little taller.  I am not that someone.  They seem well made, only time will tell.
Is very good product,  light weighted and protective. The thing is that is not quite breathable. I bought these for my husband, truck driver and if the weather is cold and snowing are the bomb. But if is warm and raining he will have an unpleasant odor.
Nice fit, light weight and nice looking shoe!
Great Comfortable shoe, As someone who's job requires to be on my feet for the majority of my workday,  these shoes meet my criteria for comfort and protection.
Love this boot, its comfortable for me and after a long day my feet still feel pretty good. Wear on sole is good as well, about average for most boots I've worn. Replaced the insoles right off the bat though so can't really judge them. Would by again
Great item would buy again
My husband has very wide feet but he loves these. He only wears Skechers for work now. He is a contractor and they are the only shoes he can stand to wear all day. Good support, they last when other shoes give out. He is very hard on his shoes. These ones have lasted longer than any other work boot or brand.
He loves em' for work
I am a IBEW JW electrician.<br />I spend a lot of time up and down ladders, thru metal detectors, walking here and there<br />I used to buy Red Wing Union made at like $150-$200 a pair, and they only last like 6-8 months because 99% of people will rub their heels down on both feet and when you don't stand correct, your lower back will hurt.<br />I got 2 different kinds of the Skecher shoes, and these are the lower priced ones<br />Wanted NON-Metalic toe guard and also the arch support.<br />Many people at metal detectors are like,&#34;I bought non metallic...yes but the shank is metal, should have looked&#34;<br />I don't like having to always take my shoes on and off, it's annoying<br />I will, from now on get just these<br />I don't care WHAT my union brethren think because my feet are not their feet<br />It's my money, why should I spend it on shows that are in all essence, about the same price in material cost as these?<br />Get them, they are about dead on in size and width<br />I let the Red Wing guy say,&#34;if you need a 3E, then just get a 2E a half size bigger. it's the same amount of space, or get a 4E...you'll have more room to grow by the end of the day (swelling of feet)&#34;<br />Yes, but makes my feet hurt real bad after or the shoes slip around all the time....there goes $300.00 wasted on 2 pairs of shoes that I can't wear more than a few hours. One is too long and narrow and one is too wide......<br />Get your right shoe size, order these BUT make sure you get the one's that are PRIME and that offer FREE SHOE RETURNS<br />That's why I get them from Amazon<br />One pair fit like a glove, one pair, same &#34;size&#34; was like a little too narrow, so I sent them back FREE
Shoes fit and perform as expected. My feet had to adjust to them after the worn out things I was previously wearing. So far pretty pleased with them. We'll see how they hold up to the work.
Ordered size 11 box said size 11 but the shoes were size 10.5 wearable but I was not happy bout it !
first off, the shoe sent is nowhere near the color pictured... I got a very dark dingy brown, hideous.  2nd, if these are size 7.5 shoes, I'll eat my socks.  3rd, the toe is hard and narrow and squeezes like hell.  Worst shoes I've ever put on my feet.
They feel to big.  Unconfterble
I am a girl but I wear a 12w and shoes like this are impossible to find in women's sizes.  I went with a 10.5m and they fit fantastic, are comfortable, look great (really, men or women, it makes a large floppy foot look great), and serve their purpose!  I will be using this for hikes this summer, probably wear them in the winter too!  I highly recommend.
Initially fit as if they'd been manufactured with my feet in mind.  Very comfortable and warm in the cold weather.
im happy
I haven't put these to practical use yet, but I do know a bit about hard work and being on your feet all day, and these shoes are of a rugged make and fit perfectly. The original insert is flimsy and provides no support (which is the norm today), but that doesn't bother me as I always buy new inserts to begin with. I suggest a foam insert with gel insets for ball and heel. With a generic such insert with medium arch support, these are extremely comfortable on my feet! The shoe is bigger than I thought it would be base on the picture, but it's definitely rugged and and composite toe is awesome!<br /><br />I've seen others complain about a lace outlet breaking and I can understand why. There are a single single pair of plastic eyelets at the tope of the lacing, and I can imagine these will break eventually. It's nothing that can't be easily and cheaply repaired.<br /><br />I'm very happy with my purchase, and I would recommend these to anyone who needs tough work shoes (really small boots) at a very good price.
I've only been wearing these for a couple days.  Composite toe is narrow and has a small section of material that pokes into the big toe. I have a wide foot though. Has no arch support, but one can be placed in it.  Seem like good quality construction.  My first Scetchers. Nice looking shoe, though not everything  I expected of a Sketchers shoe. After wearing them and breaking them in for a few weeks I will update on if they are more comfortable
Sizing is spot on. Nice and roomy in the toe box, going 4 stars only because my skechers sneakers fell apart after 4 months...poor stitching, jury is still out on the workmanship of their workline!
Shoes run wider than anticipated. It was good for me, I have very wide feet.
No break in required!!!! Put them on and go!! I will buy this item again. I work on the flight line and they are light and comfortable. I thought that the hard toe would be a problem, but don't even know that they are there!!! Fast delivery and nice fit!!!
Got them for my husband.  He loves them because he says they are not heavy (they are steel-toed shoes), and he can<br />walk comfortable on the dock for hours, working in them.
Much lighter then my previous steel toe shoes.
They are great the best work shoes my husband has ever worn
great work shoes
Its my husbands 2nd pair, he loves them.
Very good excellent very soft shoes
First pair I ordered a year ago fit great and were very comfortable but this new pair is not. Not sure what changed but they leave the front of my foot sore after 10 minutes.
It's hard to get good work shoes, but these look smart, have great quality, and will take a shine!  They have cushioned insoles, so they are comfy.  I wear mine all day!  I had some heavy-duty Caterpillar work shoes before but they were heavy and they didn't last as long as I thought they would.
As expected.
Perfect footwear for work
Good fit and wide. Just what I needed
Shoe very good
My husband had been buying Dr. Scholl's and loved these shoes as well or better.
Bought as a gift for my nephew for his first job. He says they fit perfectly and are very comfortable.
Great shoe  I wish i could order brown
These shoes are true to size and extremely comfortable and are not as heavy as they look .
Good solid pair of shoes.  I found that the insoles that were built into the shoes lasted about a month or two before they were near as thin as paper.
Great Shoes,all I buy for work,comfortable right out of the box..
very good !
Definitely looks like a work boot, not really dressy enough for an office job, but it's a quality pair of shoes at a great price.
no comfort and no arch support.  wearing these shoes  gave me pain in my back.  don't buy.  i repeat, DON'T BUY.  WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
Very comfortable and needed no breaking in. Slip resistant soles really work.
Too much room in toe area. Comfortable shoes though
confort im spect buy again
Not comfortable. Labels permanently show. Run 1/2 size big
Muy bien !!
Good work shoes. They're not what I'd like to be wearing but they're gonna do for now. Sketchers never seems to do me wrong.
Comfortable and great support, said my hard to fit husband!
fit,but some heavy
This shoes are very comfortable, best work shoes ever, the only thing bad about this shoes it's that the leather peel off real fast ( less then a year) making them look old and ugly and, the shoe sole rip off and less than a year.
They would be better if they had been supplied with laces that were long enough to tie properly.  As it was, I had to buy new laces to fit.  Dissapointing.  Otherwise they're ok.
Great deal on non slip dress shoes (which I wear for work) They look nice and are very comfortable.  Had them about a month.  I hope they last.
Excellent and comfortable.  Very good for work
Nice pair of shoes. Comfortable but a bit stiff. Leather is shiny black. Good as everyday work shoes.
They're okay soft sole and very comfortable
I normally wear a size 9.5 but these shoes run a little large I should have bought a 9. Otherwise great product.
Very comfortable shoes.
Shoes are as expected, Shipping on time. Good job.
I've been wearing this brand for many years. Is the firs time I order this style. They are very confortable.
Shoes fit perfect. Just not as comfortable as I had hoped for.
Good sturdy show for the price.
They fit as expected good arch nice padden
No issues with them so far, look great and fit and feel is superb. Defiantly well surpassed what I was expecting for the price
I need size 9 ..this is size 11 to big
very beter shooooooooooos
They fit great and look nice. The memory foam insole is pretty comfortable, but I still put my gel slips in them for a little extra support. They have a nice heel pad as well so slipping the shoes on is very comfortable. They seem to be  a little roomy and an extra pair of socks is needed. I work in a moderately wet area, the non-slip is fantastic, but not quite sure how long it will take the leather to crack. In the meantime, though, lookin pretty stylish.
Love them..
My second pair.
Fits just great. The insole of these shoes are really soft feels great on my feet.
Perfect shoe. Looks extremely well made. The sole is incredibly comfortable and I opened the package put the shoe on and went directly to a 7 hour shift of work no problem
bought size 11 what i wear too big,had to exchange for 10.5,still too big bought size 10 too small.
Love the shoes.  I wear them 10-12 hours a day, and my feet feel great.
I wear size 10 and a half sneakers but with these I should have bought size 10
Got them for work. On my feet a lot and they hold up great.<br />Only down side is the laces come untied a lot. The memory foam inserts condense and loosen them up.
Worst shoe I have ever owned!  I've worked in restaurants for 25 years and I have worn many different brands of non slip shoes.  I will say that they are indeed non-slip.  That is the only good thing I can say about them.  They are too heavy for all day wear.  The toe has no give and caused a stress fracture in my foot.  never will I buy Sketchers for work ever again!!!
Excelentes
Nice comfortable everyday business casual shoe.  Good grip on the sole, comfortable crossing large airports, does not set off metal detectors, dressy enough for a nice restaurant on the weekends.
They are comfortable as can be but somewhat larger than expected. But I already wore them so I can not return for smaller size
No comment!
They fit great  and comfortable.
excellent
These are very comfortable, well made shoes.  Well worth the price.  I would recommend these to folks who stand long hours and work on hard surfaces, like concrete.  They have elastic on the inside of the shoes that may be tight at first but once you wear them they stretch out nicely.  The produce was delivered within the estimated time frame and packaged well for protection.
Not 100% slip resistant, but still a very good shoe. Very well made, very good quality. I would definitely buy them again.
Very good product serves well for work..
I picked these shoes after doing some online research. I work in a fast paced night club and at a local video game store. These shoes were not comfortable. It claims to have a memory foam insert for added comfort. In reality, the insert is what would normally be used in a shoe as padding. Otherwise there is bare (what looks to be) cardboard and rivets holding onto the sole. I would not recommend these to anyone. After giving them one week of work a shot, I might try to return these.
thank you!
I'm giving this a 5 star rating on the basis of delivery. ...they are a life savor, I needed it to and I ordered it yesterday and it came this morning! ...as far as the fit?...well it is a gift for my husband, but I am certain they will be fine...I myself only wear Skechers with memory foam and my husband is on his feet all day and I think that these would be perfect for him...Thank you again!
I walk about 7 miles a day at work and they never seem to break in. Tried these for three weeks. They start out fine but after the first hour the balls of my feet start to get irritated. By hour 8I can't wait to get them off.
The shoes were too big and we could not return them. Great shoe but the size was not accurate. Not true to size.
Nice price....
One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever put on my feet. I would recommend to anyone that needs a great shoe.
These shoes are comfortable and will purchase again.
These shoes were very comfortable right out of the box!
They great shoes and i would give it 5 stars but the soles separates after 6 months of bending and kneeling. Its a manufacturing problem they haven't solved. I have owned  Four of them. I work in a grocery store.
It was very well made and look good.
It's not pleasing to the eyes and is pretty stiff.  The toe area is cavernous and juts up like a mesa.  I'd probably wear it if I were doing construction or a lot of kicking and have a weird sense of fashion.
Great shoes and comfortable . Leather quality is not up to Skechers quality . Over all a great work shoe .
Very comfortable shoe and it looks good with casual dress pants.  The sole is non slip with many crevices and picks up and holds moist soil.  I got in some trouble tracking dirt in the house and office, so beware if walking in dirt or small gravel.  The fit was better than expected and I have wore these all day long with no issues.
These fit my feet far better and are much more comfortable than my last pair of work skechers: the Rockland slip-ons.
The shoes don't come in half sizes so I bought a size 12. the shoes fit a little loose and I think size 11 may have been a little tight. I like the shoes so far.
These are very nice shoes. Some days I'm on my feet all day 10 hours, others I'm in and out of peoples homes. The shoes give me great support<br />and comfort all day. They slip on and off as needed yet fit without being loose. They also look great. Good enough to wear any time any where.<br />These are great shoes. I am going to buy another pair, just because. I'm very happy with them.
Very Light and Comfortable, but...<br />I got them less then two weeks ago. Good shoes if you have them on for 1-2 hrs a day, but If you wear them for 8-10 hrs a day for every day (for work), they will not last long. They get to soft and flimsy, very lose and uncomfortable by the end of the day and my feet get very tired because of that. So bottom line is that i would recommend them only if you ware them for maximum 1-2 hrs a day.
Got these for my husband because he ruins shoes every 3 months at work.  He loves them so far and I have high hopes because they are chemical and oil resistant that they will last way longer.
Shoe came promptly as advertise, fit well and i'm happy.
I am about to order a third pair of these. I wear them everyday, including during the winter, and they last years (3-5 I believe it's been for each). The current right shoe is literally falling apart (see pics), but are still comfortable and fine in a few inches of snow.<br /><br />4/7/15 update: I've been wearing the new ones as house shoes and used the steel toe ones for outside of work.  These ones are even better than the previous 2. Very clean / shiny look and more padding; very comfortable.
excellent
Comfortable but supportive
These shoes have their pluses and minuses. I pulled out the factory pads and put in my orthopaedic insoles and I love them.<br />Except the no-slip soles should be called debris collecting soles. They get clogged full of cut grass, collect small pieces of gravel, and in a machine shop, any bit of metal you may step on. Not real good when you walk back and forth from a finished wood floor to the shop.  I will say that I haven't slipped.
Since these shoes are described as being a relaxed fit, I expected them not to be especially snug along any dimension.  I do not have difficulties with my arches, the arch support does not seem to be any greater than your average shoe.  This version of the Sketchers Men's Cottonwood Slip resistant work shoes have the same fribble sole pattern as the other Sketchers work shoes but the construction comprises more pieces of leather.  My prior pair of sketchers (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENRO05W) were junk. The toe to mid-sole was one piece of rubber coated &#34;leather&#34; which too quickly bubbled and peeled.  I do not expect the same difficulty with this model as it is actual sewn leather.  I chose to coat them with black shoe polish to reduce the chances that moisture might cause drying/cracking of the leather itself, but these definitely seem to be of much higher quality than the other model.  The insole does include a small bit of memory foam at the heel but besides being a whiz-bang marketing gimmick, its not really all that special.  One small tip, the laces are round rather than flat which may tend to loosen more often- simply add another wind or half-wind around the big loop when tying (ie there will be two wraps in the center of the bow) before you pull the other loop through.  The extra wrap will reduce or eliminate the knot from loosening or untying.
Shoes fit perfect. Very comfortable. A little heavier than expected. Arrived on time.
Met expectations.
Definitely need to be broken in. Comfortable otherwise. Fit quite a bit larger than listed
Vert comfortable
no slip and comfortable
Good price, solid construction, but shoes have no arch support at all. Other reviews said to order half size smaller and that's because the shoes are flat. I added some inserts to help with the lack of arch support, now the shoes are very snug. I'm sure they'll stretch out some. Overall seem like a good value. Hope this helps.
Great shoes and comfortable
I love scketchers. I started wearing them for work for my second job and by the end of the day they my feet are in pain. Work shoes my butt. They feel cheap. Your better off buying other scketchers with thicker souls..
Great traction in kitchen floors<br />My 4th pair is same as the first<br />Will buy again
Thx
Hi yo!  Yeah,  if you're thinking of buying these,  don't.  These were some of the most uncomfortable shoes  I've ever had.  I  am a fan of sketchers shoes,  but I would've  expected better than this,  especially since they were expensive.  There is no foot  support  whatsoever,  and I just put in gel inserts,  and  still  very little improvement in the way these feel.  For a work shoe,  I hope you don't have to be on your feet  much.  Because,  OUCH!  There's no real padding  in the uppers either.  I don't know what other shoe to recommend.  I  needed something  dressy,  but capable of supporting my  feet  during alot of walking  around and standing.  Nothing is comfortable about these from the time I put them on to the time  I gratefully can't wait to take them off.  Unfortunately,  I  will have to suffer with these for  as long as they last,  because I can't  afford to  try  out others.  I  usually  wear my  nuovos when I can get away with  not having to  look all business dressed up,  or I have to have the better support for long periods on my feet.  If anyone can suggest a  good,  comfortable,  and durable  business  dress  work shoe that really supports your feet  well,  I would be grateful for your suggestions.
At most I use them for maybe 30 minutes max because I'm not working on the shop floor. They work well.
comfortable shoe for a steel toe work shoe.
These are great and its my second pair.... Er.. first pair with memory foam and second pair of sketchers work shoes. I do however have one complaint. I never liked the insoles (plain or memory foam). I replaced them with spenco polysorb insoles as soon as I got them (both pairs).<br />Quality<br />They hold up well working around aircraft and chemicals we use in the hangar. Much better than any bargin brand work shoes. I like the steel toe feature even though it isn't required.
At first they were a bit stiff. Thought they might have been too small. I have a wide foot. They broke in quick. Molded right to my feet. They are extremely comfortable. I forget they are steel toe shoes.  They are holding up nicely.  I've been happy with every pair of Sketchers I own.
Usually I get size 11 even tho I am 10.5 and it fits fine most of my shoes, but this ones were a little too big.
Good Shoe for the money
The steel toe section is a little bit uncomfortable, but otherwise they look good and are a good working shoe instead of wearing boots.
My husband loved them.  Very comfortable.  For his line of work, must wear steel-toed shoes in facilities that he visits.
Dad says it's perfect for long driving.
great
Purchased this model when it came up on the daily deal, for $24<br /><br />Didn't know  what to expect, other than knowing Skechers is a well known shoe company.<br />They appear to be well constructed, the one thing I noticed is that the toe box is a little bit wider than usual, now this is a plus in my opinion<br />I ordered my standard shoe size 10 D. the length fit well, so did the heel area, however the toe box is a bit wide.<br /><br />With the shoe being a little bit wider, adding quality gel inserts will not be a problem, otherwise it would be uncomfortable.<br />Had I known they were this good I would have purchased a second pair for a back up.<br /><br />Have worn them daily for a couple of weeks, will see how long they last.
I love these shoes. The only shoes that I buy is Sketchers.
These are good steel-toe shoes, I would recommend them, but they're a little heavy. That may be a good thing when it comes to safety. The weight of them shouldn't turn you away from them. They're quality nice looking shoes. I'd buy them again.
Better than what I think
I am very happy with the shoes they are more than I expected. Good price as well.
The reason I gave this 4 starts is because they have there adverting patch sewn onto the top of the tongue of the shoe and they are red, Really?  Nothing a Black marker didn't take care of, Found these on sale for about $30, Very good buy.
First day I wore these for at least 9 hours working around my yard and garage. Very comfortable. Note because of the steel toe I added a 1/2 size. I usually wear a 91/2. This worked perfect for me. Not sure if you will want to do the same. I'm buying a second pair.
These Sketchers were purchased for my husband who is on his feet all day.  They are lightweight and skid resistant which is what he was looking for.  The sizing seems spot on, as he wore them to work the day after they were received - this has been a few months ago and he has had no complaints!
I really like how the sho looks and feels. First day was comfortable, then came the second day. My pinky toe started to hurt, but it's my fault for having wide feet. My heel's were in a lot of pain for I Am 250 lbs and the sole of these shoes are very thin. Had to switch back to my shoe with the air cushion. Quess I'll have to buy a gel insert for more support.
Great shoe. Foam memory is just perfect
These are the best fitting and most comfortable Skrechers I have owned. I'm on way feet more than 9 hours a day.
These boots fit perfectly and I wear them all day long with only one problem, they become very hot and have no ventilation at all but this is typical for any waterproof boot/shoe. Not really made for summer time if you work outside in the heat but if you work in a air conditioned warehouse these would be the perfect boot for you. other then that I have no problem with them they are a good pair of work boots and I would recommend them to my coworkers.
Purchased in August 2014, wore to work every day where I'm on my feet 5 to 7 hours. They are comfortable enough, but by May 2015 the sides were beginning to separate from the soles, and while I've made temporary repairs with a hot glue gun, these shoes should have lasted more than nine months.
Purchased these for my son that's a Chef and on his feet all day. He has wide feet and it's often difficult to find shoes that provide enough support yet are comfortable enough to wear all day. He's very happy
Great  shoes!!!
These shoes are fantastic. They are really good for extra support if you have feet problems as they give incredible support.
My husband loves them.  He's on his feet for 13 hours a day, and even though no shoes could keep him happy for that amount of time these come very close.  He's very happy with them.
they are poorly made, glue is becoming undone and i've only had the over a week
nice
My husband loves them very comfortable for when u are on your feet all day
Item as described, no problems
These shoes are a dream! I wore them all day at an amusement park and my feet felt great afterwards. Update: 4 months of wearing the shoes and the entire right top side blew out.
Comfortable working shoe.  Good value.
Loved
somewhat too wide
they hurt my feet,not your fault,all low quarter shoes are like that,I forgot that,will not wear them at work..
They work as expected. I am on my feet most of the day and they don't hurt or get tired as much when I wear them.
Very poor quality. The shoes have already fallen apart. For having them just over 4 months you would think that they would have held up longer. I would not recommend this product.
Comfortable .
Hubby wears these out...literally. I buy 2 or more pairs a year, because he wears them so much. They are VERY comfortable and great. He wears a 12W and they are perfect for him.
I probably should have purchased a higher quality pair of Sketchers (higher priced), but  this is only my second pair and don't know the sizing very well. I also need EE width and I could not find many styles that had 9EE available.
I bought them because they had memory foam. The memory foam was only by the heal. And even then it didn't go all of the way to the back. If you say it has memory foam the whole foot pad should have it.
i chose 9.5 US = 44 Eur from the table Size Chart but in truth 9.5 = 42.5<br />so the shoe is small and narrow<br />what can i do now ?
Fits good. Very comfortable.
wrong size, can't really say anything about the shoe
Excellent choice
Same shoes I buy in the stores, however, these cost way less.
My husband loves these shoes.  This is like his 3rd pair.  Takes a while to wear them down.
Shoes are great, but i was hoping they had the full memory foam foot soul. But it doesn't. The memory foam only covers the heel.
good product, comfotable to wear.
very comfortable work shoes. the memory foam makes all the difference.
I purchased these shoes for a job I do part time and they seem to fit fine.  I deal with some foot issues and so far the Sketcher Relaxed Fit seem to work well for me.  I have purchased Relaxed Fit in the past with no bad effects.  I am happy with these shoes so far.
The padded arch support is a little too firm.  Otherwise the shoe is very comfortable and makes an excellent work shoe.
The best work footwear in the wold.
Great shoe for the price..
These are comfortable shoes to work in.<br />I work on concrete floors and they do well.<br />I'm on my feet all day.
Cons<br />I have being using this shoes for about 3 months just for work. But they starter to rip from the sides. I always buy sketchers but this shoes came out no good.<br />Pros<br />They are really comfortable and the price is not too high. But still they should have last longer.
Bought them for my husband who is a commercial electrician. He says the are very comfortable and his feet don't hurt at night anymore. He would definitely recommend them. Fit true to size
The Shoe took a bit to break in but once broke in after a week or so, now I can wear them all day and they dont hurt my feet. Before then, they did hurt my feet but now they are great to wear and comfortable.
footbed liner pulls out easy allowing for orthopedic insert
Bought these before and really enjoy the comfort and support.  Best work shoes I have owned.
Great!
Best fitting shoes I have had in a long time, and comfortable on my feet.  I wear them all the time and ordered another pair.  I used to buy SAS shoes but they no longer feel as they used to and are heavier on my feet.  Love these Skechers.
Great Shoes
bought same size as always but width was very uncomfortable...returned them
I brought this for work because I stand for long periods of time. This is a very comfortable sneaker, the sole nicely padded.
excellent work shoes for people in the restaurant business
Didn't fit very well but owe well
These shoes are not as comfortable as one would expect. The &#34;memory foam&#34; is present only on the heel. The insole is simply at thin piece of foam over a very hard shoe bottom. I'm actually surprised, because I am a fan of the Skechers &#34;Go Walk&#34; series which are very comfortable and have the memory foam. I am a nurse, so I need a shoe that is leather and not cloth, and I was hoping these would do the trick. Not the case. Also, these white shoes are an off white, not actual white
Not happy with product,shoes worn 2mnths split from front along side,not water proof seems luke they were put togethet with elmers school hlue
The size 13 E fits just fine.
Shoe fits comfortably, very cheaply made though.  After 5 weeks, the outside of the both shoes blew out.  The leather is not attached to the sole very well, a 1 inch hole on both sides of both shows, also on the inside of one of the shoes it is starting to come apart.  This is only after wearing them 3-4 days per week for 5 weeks, of course they only have a 30 warranty period so I guess they get thrown in the garbage, wont try sketchers again.
My last set of shoes (13 standard - not WIDE like I just got) actually caused me to injure my left big toe - I'm happy to say that the new shoes fit perfectly for my long days on my feet, and are allowing my foot to heal nicely.  Great set of shoes!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Just over 1 year later - First, I commend Sketchers for doing something many other shoes have failed to do - maintain their heel.  Most other shoes, because of the way I walk, grind down the outside back corner of the heel creating an angle that makes for a slightly bow-legged approach to walking - not good for either posture or ankle health.  So good job there Sketchers!  Buuuut...<br /><br />Second - just like many posts I've just seen here in the reviews, both shoes have split away from their treads along the front where the most bending occur.  Worst yet, the left shoe has torn away from its heel now.  Seeing that all this happened relatively recently, and the fact that this is my everyday pair of work shoes, the fact that they failed when other shoes are still intact (just not healthy for my feet due to heel wear), forces me to lower my star rating on these shoes.  It is rare to find shoes of this size, so I guess I'll have to replace them with the same type, unless Sketchers have come up with something new that fit my big fat feet.
I always get the next size up as I wear a heavy sock. Some of the reviews I read I believe that, that is the reason for discomfort. Don't purchase your exact size if you are going to wear a heavyweight sock...my opinion.
GOOD SHOE FOR THE PRICE.
Perfect for work
My second pair.  Skechers are great shoes.
Just got these in the correct size this time.... Anyway they feel as good as a new shoe. The new memory foam seem ok, not sure how long it would last. As These shoes are fully covered they do get a bit warm so foot powder is highly recommend. I been using all of Skechers Works shoes for the last 3 years their soles work great with our cutting fluid and never slipped on wet floors. Also they are nice and thick so the machines vibrations on concrete floors aborbs them great.<br />The only problem so far, and as to be expected on new shoes is the odd crease around the toe. But in time they soften and it's not a problem.
I have been wearing the Sketchers Keystone shoes. When I got to the point I needed to replace my last pair, I have been getting about a years use out of them, the Keystone were currently unavailable. I found these Feltons and thought I would give them a try. So far so good. I've have only had them a few weeks, but so far they are working out great. They fit me well. Are wide enough for my feet. The slip resistance is good enough for the clay tile floor in the kitchen I work in. I would recommend these shoes.  Update 7-5-2015  After only about four months the right shoe is starting to split where the upper meets the sole at my big toe. I have never had a pair of Sketchers start to show signs of wearing out after this short amount of time.   It looks like I will be sending Sketchers an e-mail.   I have become very disappointed with this pair of shoes.
Its good for a few days but after a while there is a weird bend and everytime im walking it slightly crushed my small toe on my left foot. I may clean it up and return it. We'll see
Great Product, Factory Proven
I bought these shoes for work(they are a &#34;Work Shoe&#34; and they are falling apart.  The sole has ripped away from the uppers on the side.<br />Very poor quality
Very uncomfortable i wore them one day at work and they made my back and feet hurt .id retun them but i wore then already
The left shoe's tongue is shorter than the right's. The shoe also bends abnormally. It bends between the toe cap and the shoe line. Could have a better design.
just a little to big, but other than that they fit good
Perfect, except for the shipping but Amazon made in right. She's fit great will order more since I can't find them here where I live.
Arrived within timeframe and fit comfortably.<br />Update: two months later they are falling apart. Both sides in the front have holes in them and the inside of the heel is all blew out. For $50 you don't get very good quality manufacturing.
The work shoe is comfortable, but could use a little more cushion. Good Buy!
I work in a restaurant where I walk about 10 miles a shift. We're required to have non slip shoes and I have been through many with price ranges from 30 - 100 dollars. The cheap ones gave out and became uncomfortable rather quick. The more expensive ones lasted a bit longer but felt like they weren't worth that much money. And then we have these shoes. These are honestly the most comfortable shoes I have ever had for my job. Highly recommend to anybody in the restaurant industry trying to upgrade from the typical shoes for crews or other nonslip brands out there.<br /><br />Maybe the only thing I could say bad about it is that it runs like a half a size larger but they're still extremely comfortable larger than anything I've owned.
Working 12-15 hours a day on my feet were taking a toll. I noticed immediately the improvement. I would recommend to anyone and when needed will replace with the same shoes.
They are very comfortable shoes fit perfectly however the shoes doesn't last for long time. after two months I need new pair for the shoes become uncomfortable.
It s very comfortable for me...
Great for comfort but not recommend if you work in a food place.
I wear these as a waiter and they are extremely comfortable.  They are nice and roomy, but the insole is fit in, so you can't remove it.
After wearing these shoes around 20 times the sole of the right shoe is peeling off. Hope to get a replacement pair. I am a big fan of sketchers shoes this pair is definitely defective.
I've been looking for shoes for about a year, and I have tried at least 30 different types of slip resistant shoes. These are comfortable right out of the box, and fit the bill beyond any of my expectations. They look like a walking shoe, but fit my attire. Would highly recommend.
Very comfortable work shoe that is slip-resistant. It does look more casual than something work related. Have had many compliments from other co-workers and they are shocked that they are Sketchers. I'll buy these again or get the next upgrade.
Bought for my boyfriend and he loves them. Feels like walking on air. He's on his feet all day long and no complaints
Awesome pair of shoes. Impressed
Awesome shoe to wear everyday.<br />Comfortable like a sneaker but nice enough to wear to work.
Very comfortable
Excellent shoes. Very comfortable. Great price. Delivered on time.
Awesome product and speedy delivery!
I actually tried these on at DSW shoes FIRST! They fit extremely well and I have very wide flipper feet like a duck. After trying them on and looking for an excuse to not buy it in the shoe store I could find none. They fit like a custom made suit or a car with every option! These shoes are slip resistant, feel so light on you dont know they are on. I walk heavy and hard about three miles per day on hard concrete monday-friday and wear shoes out. So when I say comfortable I mean heaven on earth. You will not need any extra inside special shoe insoles like DR. or Gels etc as it comes standard. Well I plan on many orders of this exact shoe and NONE other. Also, I wear a suit and tie everyday and thee shoes in all black know one notices its a slip on type etc and feels better than sneakers costing over $200.00.
I work for an RGIS inventory and am on my feet a lot she's seem to work for me
I still love them. just a little to big
Extremely comfortable, if sometimes a little warm - the memory foam does act as an insulator. I live in southern California, but when we move back to a colder climate, I expect these shoes to be my favourite possessions.
Very comfy and spongy, love them!!
five starts
My favorite pair of shoes for the office!
âœ”ï¸âœ”ï¸âœ”ï¸
The perfect slip on shoe for walking around work. The nonslip soles are perfect.
Very comfortable.  I'm pleased
Good
Super confortable love them so far
Great shoe and great price.
Very comfortable
Very nice to wear all day.The non slip works great
Perfect pair of work shoes,my feet doesnt hurt anymore !!!!!
they're pretty good.
Great work shoes for every server .
She was really comfortable I like it
I bought these shoes for my husband who is on his feet all day, and he is very happy with them.  They are comfortable even at the end of the day.
Good shoe and comfy. Toe of shoe is oddly big like most non-slips.
Nice fitting shoe, well made and comfortable. I would recommend this shoe for someone who does a lot of standing on hard surfaces. The shoe provides good support.  The product was shipped timely and well packaged.
Shoe provides great comfort, but for my work environment which is on rough surface concrete, they only held up for a month. The upper was like new but the sole was worn out. Would be an awesome smooth surface work shoe I think.
Very comfortable and light weight.as described,looks great I'm definitely buy again in future.
Hurts my feet
Very comfortable shoes. Bought these mainly for work, but I use these all the time
These shoes are super comfortable and perfectly slip-resistant. I don't think you will find a better shoe as far as comfort and slip-resistance. Also they fit well and you can go all day in them. Buy them and you won't be dissatisfied.
these shoes are slip and shock resistant, i can't speak for the shock resistance, but these are definitely non-slip work shoes, I work in a kitchen and I have zero problem walking over wet surfaces. i feel like the tongue should be a tad bit longer, but i feel that way with all skechers shoes. these fit me perfectly, great for work and being on your feet for extended hours at a time, and I occasionally go running in them also. they are a good all-around shoe
These shoes are very light and comfortable. I've been using these for 2 months now, 5 days a week and on my feet for most of my days. The shoes seem to be holding up well and my only real complaint is that last week they started squeaking on most polished floors.
I'm satisfied but not blown away.
ok on fit.
Very comfortable. The shoe itself is very light and feels like you are walking on air.
they are so perfect for restaurant or any place for daily base so lightweight and memory foam awesome love it i highly recommended thank you sketcherâ€¦.
Work in a automotive repair shop for 10-12 hours per day. Constantly walking and standing on concrete floors and walking thru oil, water, coolant, other fluids and shoes do not slip and are very comfortable.
I'm wearing at work every day love them fit perfectly good and comfortable to they do everything that it says it dose ill defenly buy another pair when I need them so far no problems
I work 60 hrs a week when I choose shoes for work I always look for two things comfor and non slip these Skechers are good
I love these shoes. I work in a automotive shop and am on my feet 8-10 hours a day. They are very light weight, breathable, and I can stand on them all day without my feet being sore. It's like walking on pillows. I now have 2 pairs and alternate them every day to keep them fresh. I've had many other pairs of Skechers for work and these are by far the best. They are so good that at least 10 other guys in my shop have ordered them and more are joining the bandwagon. Get them, you won't regret it!
New gig working security with Major League Baseball. Lot of standing walking on concrete. Sturdy comfortable shoe. Non slip great support. Highly recommend this shoe. Got overnight shipping and great price cost lot less than other shoes.
i really love the shoes but i am leaving a three star review because after 3 days of light work use the cloth on the outsides of the shoe where the shoe bends where you walk it has torn on both shoes already it makes me wonder if they will hold up theses are my first pair skechers i really hope i didn't waste $50.00...I'm back after a week and a half they have gotten alot worse makes me wonder the quality of theses shoes. very disappointed but they are sooooo comfortable. here is more pictures..I am sending them back and getting a diff pair
Comfortable for all day.
Very comfortable and incredibly light- Nike Air has nothing on these,plus memory foam insoles!!
Very comfortable ! ! I like it !! :)
Great pair of shoes. Fits great and are very comfortable. Highly recomended!
Comfortable
Not as expected
Very uncomfortable boot
I have that goofy foot side. A little wide but not &#34;WIDE&#34;. It makes standard sizes too tight and wide sizes too loose. I have started wearing orthotic inserts to help with Plantar Fasciitis and it makes standard shoes way too tight. I use the inserts and it made these boots fit just right (10 1/2 wide).<br />These boots are some of the best I have purchased in a long time. very comfortable from the first day and getting better. They stay tied and came with premium woven laces. Nice grip on the bottom, great for working on a ladder.<br />If I had one thing I would change it would be the tongue. I would make it about 1/2&#34; taller as it just covers the top lace without using the gusset's. I never use the gussets so it is not a problem for me but may for someone who uses the gussets. I will keep my eye open for these in the non steel toe model as I would like to try them for off-site use.
The length fits as it should.  Others stated that the normal width size is good for wide feet but not so for my taro patch feet; I should have ordered the wide option.  Feels comfortable and appears to be a pretty good boot for the price...let's see how long they last.
Nice boots but a little bigger than normal size
Happy after my first week wearing them. Definitely non skid and durable. The lacing is strange. They have hooks like most boots but then the last two at the top are back to eyelets so if the laces slip off the hooks you can't just grab it and wrap it around the hook again because the end of the lace is in an eyelet. You have to grab the lace in the middle and pull it over the hook. It's a bit of a chore for me. Once they're on though, they're comfortable. Glad I got them on lightning deal for almost half price or it'd bother me a lot more.
prefect  i like it
My husband is picky about his work boots he said these are very  comfortable and light.
Great product and price
Very good boots
Not as heavy as the Sketchers steel toe shoes that I replaced with these and very comfortable. I think it may be the &#34;relaxed fit&#34; part of them that makes them feel kinda lunky. If it wasn't for that, they'd be 5 star.
So far these are the most comfortable boots ever. Hopefully they will last long. Just noticed an air noise when I walk on the right foot. Usually that means air pocket between sol of boot.
They were too small in the toes and rubbed wrong
It is cheap enough but provid good enough quality.However the steel toe bothered my right foot a little,not feel very smooth inside.
last time i bought them but delivery failed and the i ask the service they said it's broken and permit me to buy it again as the same price when it has stock.<br />this time after several time waiting is so happy that it's so good.<br />I wear it one day to fit it . it's quite nice<br />but you know it's summer now i need to wait to next winter.
Very comfortable and good for working all day. Only problem I have with these work boots is that they seem to be tearing fairly easy on the inside and the memory foam is gone from continued use. Other than that they're great and they look just as good as Timberlands. Plus the steel toe is a nice touch as well. Will probably need to replace in another 6 months or so.
it`s too large~~~~
really a cheap one but good in quality. it is bigger than my sport shoes size so i chose one size smaller and fit me well. don't afraid of steel toe that can protect your feet and keep the shape of shoes. not too much additional weight comes from steel toe.
Great value, relaxed fit and steel toe as promised
Tough but too tough, a little bit larger than I expected.
Too heavy returned item
good
I ordered a wheat color but send a dark brown to me.....light weight, comfortable shoes I like it!
Good product
My husband normally wears a wide but these are a great fit for him.  They are relaxed fit so that makes perfect sense.  He loves the comfy insoles.
Very nice general leather work boot with quality construction.<br /><br />I have used Skechers work boots before and they have held up well over a year or more of daily use, which is why I also purchased these for my dad when he recently needed a pair.  Very comfortable, easy to lace and the padded collar is great.  Fit at size 13 is spot-on.<br /><br />Classic, understated styling that looks as good on the town as it does at a worksite.  Surprisingly, these were lighter than my current steel toe work boots, which is a huge plus.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended!
Great boots for the price! Not much arch support, but I have very high arches and have never had a pair of boots that had enough support. Even the expensive brands are lacking.
These were a great deal on a good pair of work boots.  They fit wide, so I was happy that my big feet fit in there perfect.<br /><br />The boots are light, and almost cant tell they are steel toe.  Looking forward to wearing them through the summer work season.
Thank you.
A very comfortable boot that provides sufficient protection for day-to-day hazards in a heavy-duty work environment.
Exactly as described and expected!
Comfortable
I ordered these shoes for my son, when he was hired for the produce department of our local supermarket.  The job requires slip resistant shoes, and these were perfect.  He wears skate shoes anyway, and these look cool enough for him to be happy.  He likes the fit and the comfort, and they are no heavier than regular skate shoes.  The steel toes were not required, but a good idea, in case he drops a watermelon on his foot.
It nice but steel toe to small and short
very satisfied
Still breaking then in but so far so good. Pretty stylish.
Fits just a little bit small. Seems to be adjusting as i use it right now. Been using it for a week and is great. I'd give it 5 stars if not for the fit. Great shoes overall.
I wish they had some more arch support but surprisingly they are still very comfortable and breathable enough. I use them in a wood shop and some of the shavings get stuck in the tread of the shoe but it is to be expected with the nonslip design. I wish they had a bit more of an arch and I would have given them 5 stars! The shoes have lasted since purchase and show no premature wear, they are not as heavy as my old safety shoes and look like a regular shoe.
Better have small toes or else expect some serious bunions and blisters around the toes
Is no contribul stel in front
2 months on the job and pretty much dead ripped at seems in toes. sole falling off left shoe.
Good
By far the most comfortable work shoes/boots I've worn. A little heavy but not bad considering the steel toes. Highly recommend
Good value for steel toe footwear
I have never worn steel toe shoes before . I think these are more comfy than others I tried on. They are a good deal and don';t look too bad
No slip, modern skate style and steel toe are perfect for long bartending hours! These fit perfectly and the rest of my staff are interested in ordering!
The shoes fit somewhat well, a little bit tight around the small toe. Other than that. They fit well, comfortable... But time will tell. Stay posted for an durability update
Thank you very much
Review for Skechers Gibson Kirby Steel Toe shoes. The shoes are ok, it's nice to have a pair of steel toes in sneaker form. Very disappointed in how long they have lasted though. Honestly, the cheaper walmart brand shoes lasted longer. The left shoe is ok right now, but the right shoe side has degraded where the sole and shoe meet. Having the shoes for 2 months, working in an office, I expected them to last longer. My sock is now exposed on the outside where a 3&#34; rip or tare has happened. Looking at it closely though, it doesn't seem to be a rip, but more like the material has worn thin from every day use. I won't be buying another pair of these.
They fit great very comfortble to wear all day the best steal toe shoe i have owned.
Great shoes for work!
the shoes are comfortable. however they only lasted a month before the foam in the heal fell out. also dont step in puddles, they are not at all water proof.
Can,t tighten shoes on your feet ,  update. .. not  slip resistant. AMAZON  refused to upload my photos showing my injuries caused by not having slip resistant.
The boots are very comfortable and seem to be generally well made.  The gel cushion might become detached if you are on a steep slope (happened the 2nd day of having the boots).  I use the boots all day for outdoor work and they are comfortable.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and would consider purchasing again.
These boots are nice and comfortable. I was a little concerned at first because of the memory foam and the Sketcher brand on a pair of boots. I questioned durability and comfort. I've been wearing them for several months and I have to say that they are awesome. The memory foam, you will know it's there as soon as you step down and with any change of position. The creases by the toe make a big difference in comfort and durability. This boot has it all. I'm skinny and these are Relaxed Fit boots, they are meant to be a little loose around the legs for people with skinny legs. However I'd recommend a different boot for skinny people. Also their was a lot of flashing on the outsole. That I didn't like.
Ok
Comfortable all day on the farm. Exactly what I was looking for.
Ok
I love these boots. I will buy another pair if needed.
Maybe a fine pair of boots but I've written a10 for more than 30 years in every thing but these were way to big. I own a half dozen pair of of sketcher shoes and they all fit fine. These just don't
I wish I had purchased a couple more pairs when it had the discount coupon.  Definitely recommend!  I worn it while I was overseas and had to walk all day.  Feet didn't feel fatigued afterwards.
somewhat large
They fit great. Not the most comfortable for a 9 hour day, I would recommend getting insoles to help with that.
I needed to replace some old, really old, work shoes and liked what I read about these. They are a perfect fit, comfortable and should last!
Very comfortable, since I am on my feet all day these boots are a pleasure to work in.
no good
The cortex has the crease onece you have it on,Soles can not be worn enough.
back up shoe when my other breaks down..I love the style and fit.....
the shoes as i expected
These boots run a little too big. Other than that, it is a good boot.
These boots are amazing!! and so comfy and I really love the memory foam insoles. I Will always continue buying my boots from amazon
great boots
My son really likes these although he was disappointed that they re steel toe as he does not need this feature.
a very heavy boot , not very comfortable while wearing
Just what I was searching for....perfect for me. Confertable worm and good looking. This is the dust time I purchased shows on internet......
four stars
Very general boots, too hard
The boots fit wider than expected and as result they were uncomfortable to wear for any extend period.  The angle length became and annoyance and made the boots even more uncomfortable.
very nice and comfortable !
Cant seem to tighten and the boots are not wide
Like the memory foam , comfy!
the 10 and a half size fit perfectly. we were extremely happy on how they exchange the shoes efficiently!
I loved these shoes! they look a bit goofy according to my G/F but i don't care I love them!
Good
Great
Very comfortable shoes but it fall apart after 2 weeks of wearing. VERY POOR QUALITY, this shoes should sale like walmart shoes for $15-20 but not 75
These shoes are perfect for volume based restaurants! Very comfortable.
A little big, I normally wear a 10, should have ordered a 9.5,  very comfortable shoe otherwise
Excellent Purchase I highly recomend.
Seems like a rubberized coating on them. Started peeling off after only 3 months working in restaurant. Have had many pairs of Skechers for Work, never been dissatisfied before. Waste of money.
goooood nice
Took a week or two to break them in. Seems the right shoe in this manufactures product line needs to be stretched for the right toe to fit properly. Could only wear the shoes for a few hours for the first two weeks. I should have sent them back, but now I'm glad I didn't. Having the same problem with the walker 3 now.
Very comfortable, very light.  Sharp enough for work.
These shoes are very comfortable to work and more people like me who have to walk a lot and go a long way and go stand on the train, I liked the shoes, at a good price here on Amazon and fast shipping, you can not ask for more.
They are just a little too big, but still comfortable. I have another pair of shoes similar to them and they are the most comfortable shoes I've worn. So here I am back to update my review. I usually wear an 8.5 or 9 in shoes, but not these. I had to order an 8.5 because a 9 was way too big. The 8.5 is still big. I would advise that if you buy these, go at least 1 whole size smaller. I probably should have gotten an 8.
Best fitting, most comfortable work shoes I've ever owned.
I really like these shoes.  They look great, light as a feather and with high quality leather.  Smart design and good craftsmanship.  Easy to slip on.  Very pleased!
This is the fit I look for! Love these shoes.
Shoes as expected
Thanks it is good and fits good
The shoe is on large side, but I'm ok with it. Just got to wear extra socks
Bought this for the sole purpose of allowing me to work through the day on my feet. This shoe allowed me to do just that as working in the medical field has me on my feet all day . This product is comfortable , lightweight and highly durable. A great purchase for people who work in a field where they are always on their feet.
Great!
Very comfortable but only lasted 2 months before ripping at the seams.
Great shoe for people always on theirfeely.
I bought these a year ago after looking for a decent work shoe for years. Work in a grocery store deli; chicken grease, slicer debris, wet soapy floors, you name it. These shoes were comfortable the minute I put them on and after 12 hours on my feet daily they were still comfy. They've lasted a year, and one of the seams is just now coming loose. I could glue and go forward, but the leather has stretched some and I need to replace the shoes. I'm getting the same thing, because for the price, comfort and durability I haven't found better!
Horrible quality, these shoes fell apart after wearing them less than a month. Do not buy!
very good, nice product.
Great work shoe for chef
Husband has tumors on the bottom of both feet in the arch (Plantar Fibromatossis) these shoes are the Best<br />Shoes he has found in 10 years.<br />This was the 2nd pair he has bought.<br />Nothing short of a miracle for him.<br />The price was $20 cheaper on Amazon<br />Than in a local store.
I bought these because I also own the Sketchers Gains shoe, they are the same design, but just brown leather.  These shoes are quite as supple as the brown leather ones.  They took a while to break in, and the size is a bit larger than the brown ones.  Overall though they are a nice shoe, the bottom is truly slip-resistant, works very well.  They do seem to be made with high quality material, I wear these a couple days a week and then the brown Gains the other days.  The brown ones feel like slippers, they are that comfortable!  These are comfortable, just not as pliable as I anticipated.
I got them for my son for work.  He spends 10-12 hours a day on his feet.  He said his feet no longer hurt when he gets home, and he feels less tired overall.
Exterior color is excellent. Arch support not bad but not as well as other skecher model. Overall, can do better.
Great Shoe, I will buy this brand again.  I wear them all day.
Although comfy and stylish, they are of poor quality. I purchased mine from the Sketchers Store and am highly disappointed. On the outer side of the left shoe nearest the &#34;pinky toe&#34; area, the stitching came apart. I only wore these at work for 4 weeks and this occurred.
Shoes look and feel great. They are very light weight. I am a little concerned they are too light and they will not hold up under daily use but only time will tell. Other Skechers I have purchased in the past are very well built and have given me years of service. I couldnt be happier with Skechers brand products. I hope these hold up as well.
Very comfortable and professional work sneakers. I work in a lab so thy are bound for destruction, but I'm very satisfied with the value. Only issue is the toungue keeps sliding down under the laces.
Very comfortable shoes !
Really enjoyed the shoes
Purchased for my 34 year old son - he loves them!
Super comfortable for being on my feet all day. Sketchers really hit it out of the park with these memory foam insoles.
light shoes ,and comfort insole
Never been disappointed by fit and confort!!
In general great shoe. The built quality is pretty good, with only minor esthetic errors here and there. But these do not affect usage. My feet are wider than average and this shoe fits them comfortably. With the foam heel support I can go for long walks without trouble.
Cooler looking than my old work shoes, but the non slick is non existent. I mean its seemingly somewhat non slick but once you start mopping you will fall unless you got mad balance skills. very disappointed and ill have to buy different shoes.
Not good
Arrived on time. But honestly this shoe has zero support. Buyer beware. Had to rid of them two weeks after
Had these for 2 months, souls are falling apart. Overall great shoes. I work 60 hours a week in a professional kitchen. Near the arch of the right soul the glue (obviously cheep glue to cut production costs) just fell apart.
Good
I bought these expecting to wear these to work. I cannot wear these to work. They are going to sit in my closet till I can donate. Super uncomfortable. Gives me blisters. Waste of money. DON'T BUY THESE just cause you think they look cool!
I wish they were a bit wider
these shoes are not good for working in the kitchen slip
These shoes literally came unglued! I own a restaurant and need to wear non slip shoes 7 days a week. I usually wear out a pair of shoes in 6-8 months. The soles and tread began to break off and separate from the shoes upper after one month of wear. Other brands make a better quality more durable work shoe for the money. I would recommend you look elsewhere.
Fit perfectly, but after about four hours on my feet, my heels are killing me.
Fell apart really quickly very poor quality for skechers
Absolutely terrible. Shoes were comfortable for about a week. Got some Dr Scholls and they were fine but after another week they completely fell apart. Sole is separated on both feet and the rubber side on the right shoe is separated. I work in a shop and wear out shoes but this is ridiculous. About 6 weeks into wearing them and they're almost unwearable. If I could give a negative star rating I would.
Feels great and really are slip resistant
Bought these for my husband for work, he loves them! He says they are comfortable all day, and he stands/walks a lot a work.
These work shoes are awesome. They fit well. One minor detail. It makes a light stomping sound when walking. But since these are for work, no problem.
Comfy
I bought these shoes for my boyfriend, as he needed new work shoes. They fit him perfectly! I slipped them on, out of curiosity, and could not believe how comfortable they were. The bottom has a squishy, soft gel feeling to it and he has had zero problems with them. Definitely a great investment for someone on their feet for long hours.
Very comfortable !!!
These shoes are absolutely great! When shopping for inexpensive slip resistant work shoes there aren't many options as far as design and overall look but these shoes definitely meet those standards. They're comfortable even after long periods of time. They do fit a bit loose in comparison to other shoes of the same size but I think I that's because of the &#34;relaxed fit&#34; but other than that these shoes are perfect. They're classy but not as formal as a typical slip resistant shoe that looks like a dress shoe. These shoes are also really sturdy and made to last. The picture does not really do the shoes justice. They look a lot nicer in person. Highly recommend
Great
Awesome shoes could not. Be more satisfied tlhabnk you
Decent shoes - my only beef is that the ring around the top back (above the heel) isn't padded, so it rubbed against my Achilles tendon &amp; created sores at first but my I got them worn in and now they fit great.
Nothing like I ordered I  hope they are as good or better in staying power
Perfect fit.  Fast delivery. Just in time for summer job at DQ. These slip resistant shoes are required for work.
great
Great shoes, slightly larger than expected but still fit fine. Slip-resistance is as expected, but you can still slip as they are not slip-proof shoes.
these are not true to size at all-don't even bother-these must be made in CHina cuz they are clueless what an American size 10 is-my fiance' had to return these cuz they were uncomfy and slipped off is heel in a dangerous way,yet fit in the toebox-so long skechers-u suck!
Purchased these shoes for my son and nephew for their restaurant jobs.  The memory foam insert allows them to stand for hours without any discomfort to their feet or back.  They are also stylish compared to other non-slip shoes.
Very comfortable and they look great. Another plus is that they're technically a work shoe. The soles are slip and shock resistant. Just make sure you wear the right socks otherwise they'll tear up your heel while they're new. There are lots of no show socks available and one in particular that I reviewed.
Very comfortable!
Thought they would be more comfortable
Great!
i like it ^_^
Comfy stylish cheap work shoesðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼
This pair of shoes is a bit too small. Not leather. Is Synthetic leather.
I ordered these for my brother-in-law for his new job.  He loved them from the time he put them on.  He said he never had a shoe fit so perfectly, especially from being ordered online.  His feet, legs and back felt great after the first day at work.  He said the shoe is so attractive and does not look like a work shoe.  It looks more like an everyday shoe.  He is sold on this brand!
The look good, and have a good tennis shoe style sole
These are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever had.  The top of the back of the shoe is coarse and it cuts into the back of my heel on every step to the extent that I had a scab after walking a half mile in them, even while wearing heavy socks.  I now put bandaids on the back of my foot and it helps a little.  If it doesn't get better I'll stop wearing the shoes.  The shoes otherwise seem fairly nice.  MY wife doesn't like the styling but I think it looks good.
Great fit, very comfortable.
Dad loves these !!
Large, wide, STEEL toe! A poor attempt to duplicate the old, non-steel toe Wolverine Boot! Too heavy for Skeacher expectations. Had I known they were steel toe I would not have ordered. I am a disabled Viet-Nam vet with leg and lower back damage, and heavy boots or shoes exacerbate the problem. If you look at the add, 'steel toe' is hard to find, yet extremely important! Could have better, skeacher insole! Needed to add a Dr Scholl's insert!
Great boot but half a size too big. Go a half a size down if you buy these boots. But other than that they are very comfortable
My husband is partial to these work shoes and continues to buy them for their quality.
I expected more a better memory foam platform. Since I already have Sketchers with great Memory Foam that I can wear all day comfortably.
Good shoes on my fourth pair
Good job. â˜º
its comfortable, but not so great working in the kitchen. the water can get through the entry of the laces
really likes it
Good as the description!
Great boots!!!! Very comfortable, just make sure to wear high socks so that the boot doesn't rub on your legs. My mistake by wearing ankle socks....
Good
i reckon it is attractive in price and quality. i like the brand of the skecher. it is comfortable shoes.
It's  good,i like it
Very Good!~
my feet are wide width, these kill my pinky toes...and I like my pinkies a-lot.<br />If you are a big dude like myself, these shoes will make you hate gravity.
Have only used them a week, but they are really comfortable. Not as heavy as other Skechers/Lugz.
I bought a pair of shoes, but I received was a math book!!!
Totally I like it and it's comfortable
I'm a delivery driver and the boots don't slip when it's wet or dry on my ramp, also really light weight
My son is hard to fit in shoes due to being flat footed and wide foot.  This boot fits him very well.
Tight in the composite toe but no more than any other composite toe boot... Very comfortable boot
These are very comfortable.
Have worn them from the first day!!! They are great, the memory foam insoles sre the best, would recommend these to anyone looking for work boots, some of the best ones I've ever bought.
Great Boots, will see how they hold up in the winter!
Very nice shoes.  The arch would be fine for most people.  I just have an abnormally high arch.  I use supports.
....... 'meh.  These are okay at best.  My husband got them for work but they hurt his feet,  have little support,  too big even with extra inserts and the sole is wearing oddly.  We have only had them for a couple months.  :-(  I wouldn't buy them again.  UPDATE:  worst work boots we've ever bought.  They didn't even last 4 months.  Do yourself a favor and buy Thorogood boots. Union Made in USA. Skip these China Junkers
Great fit
Great boots, comfortable fit had to go down a size and a half to find some that fit. Real stiff till you break them in a little, over all very happy with them. Would buy them again
Didn't fit at all
For the price a great boot.
one boot slipped on with ease the other was very hard to get on. Once I got them on they were comfortable.
Bought these for the hubs.  He loves!
A little friction of the back of the heel
I loved it very much and even my friend ordered one as well..
Great product
I had my doubts but Skechers came thru with great work shoes. I have had deer stags and shoes for crews but these are top of the line. I just got a second job and the shoes I had were fine but I sonetimes slipped even though they were work shoes. The other brands cost the sane but use cheaper materials and my feet would hurt bad after 2 shifts. As soon as I wore these beauties my feet are much more comfortable. The shoes are very well made and look like nice shoes not just ugly work shoes. They are comfortable and are superb at being slip resistent. Im getting these again.
GREAT WORK SHOE, IM ON A CONCRETE FLOOR 10 HOURS DAY.HAVE HAD 2 WEEKS NOW AND HOLDING UP VERY WELL
Nice shoe.
Been wearing these for six months now at an instant oil change place. Slip resistance is phenomenal. In fact, the company made us replace our own shoes with a brand that touts 3x the slip resistance of any other brand (according to testing). Well...not sure what they were doing in those tests but these are far more slip resistant. Not ugly like most anti-slip work shoes. Sole is peeling away from upper after 6 months of used motor oil - can't expect too much more I don't think. My only complaint - and it's big - is that they are not very supportive. They feel comfy but then when you take them off you realize your feet have been brutalized. I'm sure most any shoe would be similar if you have to stand and walk steps all day long. Get a thick gel insert from a famous shoe insert brand available everywhere - you know the one - and they are much better.
One of my favorite shoes.  Very stylish and comfortable.
Fantastic pair of shoes.  They fit my wide feet to a tee!  These will keep my feet nice and comfy as I walk around my classroom all day long.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair.
I used to buy sketchers shoes before, but those shoes are the worse than I have in my life.  Don't waste the money.
I am a big fan of these shoes. I usually go through work shoes every few month, these shoes have lasted over 8 months. I have bought a second pair only because the first pair doesn't look as nice anymore... Still holding up anyhow.
My feet started hurting after an hour and it is very uncomfortable.
These are the ONLY shoes I own (over 30 pair) that feel great all day.
Very comfortable shoes for working on a concrete floor all day. I did not realize the shoes are actually made for a factory setting so comes with a rubber no slip tag on the top of your toes.
They are good for work, but every time I come home the heel of my foot hurts, but I work on my feet all day long.
I bought these for my husband and he says they are definitely the most slip resistant work shoes he has had. The reason for not having five stars is because of lack of support, he did get inserts which helped.
Great shoes!  Very comfortable.  Durable and stylish.  I highly recommend them to anyone that is on their feet all day.
Awesome and nice dress shoes
Love the shoes
Very happy with fit and construction.Nice styling too.
Overall I'm very happy with the shoe!!
The shoes looks nice and are really slip resistant. They of course overpriced, but deserve a good score for overall quality and comfortability.
These are well-made, great-looking shoes. They are really comfortable to wear and very light. Four stars because the shoe laces are kind of short.
My husband is a General Manager of a large food & beverage operation. These shoes are great for him. They have good traction are very light and he can wear them for 14 hours without being in horrible  pain. At the end of the day his feet feel good.
so far after abt 9 months this still looks good.
Great shoes. Hard finding good shoes in extra-wide!
Purchased these for my son and he is very happy with them.  He says they are comfortable and very light, fit nicely.
Toe box could be larger, but overall satisfactory.<br /><br />The wearer has a very wide foot and sensitive toes.
Shoe is wellmade but fit seems to run a bit narrow. Feet were hurting at the end of an 8 hour work day
Great for work
Just received these shoes and find that they fit very tight for triple-E's. I'll wear them around for a day to see if they loosen up. Otherwise they will go back  Update after two days wearing these shoes - downgrade from 3 to 1 star rating.  They are awful, causing blisters on both feet so bad that I have cut my daily 8 - 10 miles to around 2 miles.  There is no way these shoes are properly sized as 10 3E's and I have requested a return authorization.
I got these shoes a year ago and they are just now starting to wear. The tread is still got but it's got a rip in the shoe, just from me working. I'm surprised the tread on the bottom lasted so long. Only a little portion of the back heel is smooth. Very comfortable and very light. I will be purchasing a new pair of shoes because of the hole, and would buy these again, but they went up in price. So I'll have to get another kind. But I would recommend this shoe to anyone with the funds.
They fit as I thought they would be. I took one star off because the first hole nearest the little toe for the lace is going to rip through soon. Other than that, excellent.
Okay shoes. Nothing special. Not sure what kind of leather these are. Maybe PU.
Not a Sketchers are created equal.  These shoes are bit longer than expected. Wide Width is as expected. I wear an 11 EW in my other Sketchers, but these for some reason fit like an 11 1/2 EW. They are comfortable, without question, but I would recommend ordering a half size smaller just to be safe.
Best kitchen shoe i have ever owned.  The are about a half size too big atleast for the wide.  This is the 2nd pair i have purchased, if you are buying these for kitchen work they`re worth the extra cash, my last pair lasted almost a year before the supports gave out.  So they are very durable on all fronts, i did use shoe polish on them a couple times to keep the leather soft so that may have helped with the durability.  I always have doctor scholls supports with mine cause the sole isn`t very good.  I would recommend these to anyone and will be back to purchase more pairs of these very durable shoes.
Been having really bad pain in my feet with my old shoes. This was the first day I wore these, and I can say my feet felt good all day. I did put in a pair of arch support insoles, but I put these in all my shoes since I have flat feet. So all in all, comfortable shoe that I think is worth buying. Would give it five stars if it had its own cushioned insole but not soft enough on its own.
So far so good on comfort
I'm a EEE wide and these are ok but not super wide (maybe a little narrow for a wide size). Other than that, for $40 oh hell yeah on these shoes. Good for getting wet but not looking it. Seem to breathe ok, comfortable (not if you're used to arch support though, if you're a converse sneaker person like me they're great), and most importantly - they look good. My gf didn't notice they weren't work shoes, so they do fine with work casual.<br /><br />These are my new &#34;it may rain and I'm walking to metro to get to work today&#34; shoes. We'll see how well they wear and last, but at first wearing I'm pretty happy - mostly with the looks. I should note I wore them all day for the first time and they did not need any breaking in. It's a good hybrid between dishwasher-able, walking in the rain without fear, and wear to happy hour with office people.<br /><br />Could range from blue collar work to kaki-button down style pretty easily.
have only had them for two weeks so i really cannot make a good review yet. so far though thay are a bit tight, i would buy a half size bigger .
good shoes
great work shoe but you may want to add some inserts
muy bueno
I had to return these.  My husband is a waiter, and I thought these were suppose to be great for people on their feet.  He said that they were &#34;very uncomfortable!&#34;  I was so disappointed, after doing much research online for shoe recommendations for people who spend 8 hours plus on their feet.  Very disappointed.
Very uncomfortable
These were my husband Kurt's purchase.  His second pair!  He works as a waiter in a winery restaurant and needs comfortable, non-skid shoes.  These fit the bill perfectly!
I ordered another pair of Sketchers work shoes in &#34;extra wide&#34; but they weren't nearly wide enough so I sent them back and ordered these. These fit great and are truly extra wide of you order that width. I'm a field technician in Arizona so I'm on my feet 8 hours a day in 115 degree sometimes. My feet don't sweat in these and they are comfortable to wear all day long. I don't really need the slip resistant part. If you're able to wear a sneaker type of work shoe and you have wide feet get these in the 3E width.
Not for people with wide feet
Good work shoe.
Great shoe, very comfortable .  No complaints
These shoes look, feel, and fit exactly as I wanted them to. I was a little unsure about purchasing shoes online, but if you're sure of your shoe size -  and I recommend having them measured at a shoe store before ordering - this will work out perfectly for you too!
I am upgrading my star rating from 2 to 3. After wearing the shoes now for over 60 days, they have finally broken in and are a bit more comfortable than my initial review below.  They are very good on a wet floor, but I still think the cushion on the bottom is not very good. I work 20 hours a week, and walk in them anywhere from 3 to 6 miles a day making deliveries.  I still won't buy another pair, but the overall comfort has improved, so I will keep them until they are worn out. Original Review Below:   I have worn these shoes for 30 days and I work in a delivery service part time.  My reason for the low rating is that the space from the bottom of the shoe under your toes and the upper leather that is above your toes is too narrow.  So with thicker socks the tops of my toes feel pressure.  I am hopeful they will improve with time, but after 30 days of wear, there is no change.  I have had other Sketcher brand work shoes that I was happy with, but not this style.  Also, there is not much cushion for the heal and pad of your foot.  I tried an insert but due to the lack of space above the toes it was not workable.
works great
Awful pair of shoes.
Wear them @ work . on my feet all day ,  lots of lifting and running . Great shoe and nice style.
Love these shoes this is my third pair
Nice shoe. Fits well. Good arch support. I am flat footed, hence this helps me a lot.
I like
I was expecting these shoes to be more comfortable...the they're not very flexable.  The quality of the synthetic material they're made of does not hold up very well...  Its been about 5 months of usage and its already time to buy another shoe.  A weird thing I had noticed about these is that I have little black marks on my toes that come off of the shoes after long usage... almost looks like bruises.... but the marks are actually whatever material or coloring from the toe end of the shoe bleeding off of it.  The front end of the shoes after 5 months is very rough and hardened...like plastic.  The shoes also aren't very breathable, so after a long day of work they tend to retain a bad oder...more so than other shoes that have more breathability.  I unfortunately won't be buying these again and will have to give other work shoes a try.
Fit great
ðŸ‘
I ordered 3E and they still squeezed the outside of my foot.
I ordered this pair of shoes based on the reviews, but they are taking a little bit to be broken in. The front of the shoe seems to be really wide in comparison to the back of the shoe, which I think it is a bit awkward. They are work shoes, so I'm not complaining, they are better than the ones I had before, but nothing crazy to rave about.
Great shoes
This is my second pair of this exact shoe.  I own/operate a quick-serve restaurant and these are the perfect shoes for everyday work.  They are actually comfortable and look pretty good too.  When they start to get uncomfortable after about a year, I swap out the insoles and get another year out of them.  Good shoe at a pretty good price.
Perfect, thanks
The best work shoes I've had. On my fourth pair. Will continue buying them for work.
So uncomfotable. Had to return.
Great shoe. I like them better then shoes for crews. The traction is great.. made out of superior  material. I am now a sketchers work fan.. I won't wear another type of shoe
Quite the perfect pair of shoes for working. I'm a professional stagehand and these bad boys are great for all day walking around. The cleats on the bottom really grip the surface of any floor you're on. I walk the ice at the Staples Center sometimes, and these things actually have saved my ass a few times from slipping.
awesome
Look great ANDROID High End Quality For A Very Goods price. I have bought  Sketches b shoes in the past And knew for the most part they were a good shoe. These shoes had high ratings and a good price and my 14 year old son needed a pair of black shoes to wear with semi dress clothing .He had them on last night with new black jeans and a nice collared shirt and it looked nice together.and he said that they fit ok.
Great work shoes, much more comfortable than any shoes for crews product
Good
These are the best shoes I have ever bought. Classy and edgy design. ))
if you have to be on your feet all day and want a soft cushion support this is it!
This are excellent shoes fix perfect and are so comfortable
There great work shoes
I love these shoes, but I had to buy inserts in order for them to fill comfortable to wear them all day.
Very comfortable shoe for work
great buy for the cost. super fast shipping with amazon prime.
I have been bartending for the past 6 years and for 4.5 of those years I have worn skechers similar to these but not the work version. First off they seem to be a bit more sturdy than my past pairs of shoes and the non slip sole was pretty good. I ordered a size 10.5 (same size as I have been wearing from skechers since I have been wearing them) and when I first put them on they seemed great, a little tight on the sides but nothing crazy. I didn't have time to break them in before work so I worked a shift in them, my feet were a little sore but nothing crazy, figured they just needed broken in. Well after 2 weeks of working in them they hurt my feet on the sides very badly. The shoe is way too big in length and to this in width. I had my friend that wears size 12 try them on and they fit him length wise but were too skinny for him too. I tried contacting skechers but they still have yet to respond to me. The insoles that came with them were terrible as well, I use to buy the skechers because of the comfort insole that they had. Since I wore the shoes to work l, I couldn't just take them off. I had to continue wearing them and could not return them because they looked used. (I did not try to return them however, I instead tried contacting skechers.)  Summary:  Cons: Too long, too thin, poor quality insole. Didn't fit my feet and hurt the small toes on my feet and the soles of my feet from inadequate cushioning. I ended up buying some merrell chameleon stretch primes and they are amazing! They are like gloves for my feet!  Pros: Good heavy duty quality and a non slip sole.  Update: still no response from skechers, so this is unfortunately the last shoe I will ever buy from them. Too bad, I have been wearing skechers for the past 15 years daily and for the past 6 years for work. Oh well, merrell will be my new go to.
Inside is a little hard, it's not soft. 1/2 number up could be the best for this model
These shoes took about a week to break in. The tongue of the shoe was really stiff, but now they are very comfortable.
Best work shoes I've ever owned. I hate clogs, so my search for a great kitchen shoe has been a long one, filled with s***ty shoes. These are great shoes.
good deal
Great shoes for my husband that has wide feet. They are smooth black leather and clean up easily. Do believe they are being discontinued so i bought another pair.
These are the sixth pair of the Sketchers Work shoes i have bought, and they have worked very well for me.  They are comfortable enough that I can wear them on days when I'm on my fee for much of the day, but they are still presentable enough that I don't need to worry about wearing them to meetings with clients, etc.
Stylish ,easy to wear for long hours .just weigh bit more than expected. Pretty happy with these shoes.
Very good
Met expectations
Size was bigger then I wanted.
Great fit,feel and look. 2 thumbs up
excellent
These seem to run a bit large for 12's but nonetheless are the best work shoe I have ever bought. I use these for restaurant work and the have eliminated my back pain and are quite stable. The tongue is a bit hard and hurt the front of my lower leg, just above my foot. So do night tighten these to much but other then that, I am very happy with these. I only work 12 hrs a week in the restaurant now so I can't give you a review on longevity but just the fact that for those 12 hours I am pain free mean I will return to these when they go.
I have high arc on my feet so insufficient on arch support of this product may not be a problem for others.  Comparing my other walking shoes, this one has lack of air circulation.  This is my only complaint.
Good shoe so far. Very comfortable and great price.
ok
Very good
Fantastic work shoe.  They look great, fit great, very comfortable with heavy duty orthotics and simply do not slip on wet concrete. Or anything for that matter! They look good enough to wear casually.  I replaced original laces with stretchy laces that have a slide and don't need to be tied. It slips on like slip on and works perfectly!
Thank you!
Best working shoes I have ever had. Great shoes!
I was not impressed on the first day of wear, but the next day they started to conform to my feet and became much more comfortable. I would give them five stars, but I don't know how long they are going to last...
Wish there were more to buy!
These shoes are great for work, not only do they fit great but they also look close to tennis shoes. They have a fairly narrow toe area for anyone who's a but wide footed.
Feels and looks good so far
Overall I was not impressed with the construction and quality of the shoe.  I've been wearing Skechers for about 5 years now, and tend to replace them about every 6-8 months with daily use to/from work.  In the last 18 months or so, the quality control has lacked and I'm now searching for a different brand of shoes in a similar style that are as comfortable as the Skechers from several years ago.  I selected 2 stars because they are not unusable, but they are not what they used to be.
Rigid, uncomfortable, with little support and what feels like no cushion, which is odd because this was my second pair of the exact same shoe and the first one had fit perfectly. I wouldn't recommend these, especially if you're on your feet for an extended period of time.
Very comfortable shoes for work....I'm getting another pair!
Fast shipping. Some what tight.  Get a wide if your debating
They are little different to what I thought, but either way I liked
Perfect for super comfortable!
My husband loves the shoes.  Really sporty looking and extremely comfortable.
Okay, not the greatest arch support (not non-existent, just not much arch support), but I don't have arch problems so they're just fine for me.  I use these for work and they're very comfortable.  I can wear them all day without a problem, my feet aren't sore after 10 hours of walking, standing, etc. on a concrete floor.  The tread is great for traction in my work environment, but they do tend to pick-up some of the messes you may walk through.  That being said, I still give them 5 stars, I really like these shoes.  Let's see how long they last...  I'll update this once I know for sure.
As a 10+ years veteran Waiter I can safely say that while these aren't necessarily the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned, one can do much much worse as I learned recently. I ordered these immediately to replace some terribly uncomfortable payless shoes after a busy Easter brunch (for the same price no less!). I think they'll hold up well for some time, but the true test of comfort and durability will be on the hellacious grind that is Mother's Day.
ONLY HAD FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND FEET STARTED HURTING AFTER AN HOUR OR SO AFTER BEING ON THEM, Definitely going back to Dr. Scholls !
My husband loves this shoe! Very comfortable and light on your feet.
These shoes fit great, are wearing well, shipped quickly, and are a good price.  It's hard to find extra wide online, and these are exactly as advertised size-wise.  If you know your size and can find it in the drop-down menu, I recommend picking up a pair.
Very comfortable shoe.
I like those shoes this is my second time that I have them
No support. Don't buy these if you work long shifts.
excelente!
These are great for work. Tough and very good anti slip.
Nice shoe
I love these shoes, so comfortable. Looking great.
Very comfortable shoes. Took little to no time to break in.
Love the shoe. Very comfortable
Excellent
Fits great
Very comfortable
Good noon slip,  not very much comfort though.
I bought these for my 12 year old son for school.  He has has huge feet for his age and he destroys shoes quite easily but he says that these fit perfectly and feel strong.  We returned another pair of sketchers and got these instead.<br /><br />I will report back once he start back school and the shoes take a beating...
Not as comfortable as I expected
Nice heel on these shoes! Very good cushion!!!
So far the shoes are holding up well and are quite comfortable. They fit as expected and I expect that they'll last quite some time.
Comfortable. Good for jobs requiring you to be on you feet constantly!
excellent producto, is very confortable
No cushioning for feet, flat soles but they are lightweight.
Very nice shoes!!!
fit as expected
Wide with box toe feels true to fit and has withstood all day wear. I am a heavier man and after a long day on my feet the shoes still feel great.
Very nice quality for the price
I am on my feet 8 hours a day. I usually wear out a pair of shoes in a couple of months. Skechers are well constructed, and can last me and my son up to a year.
Comfortable shoes
Confortable, even after 13 hrs
Good looking shoes, but they don't provide much support for your feet. I can't wear them longer than a few hours before my feet hurt.
Good but girls hate it
I wear these shoes all day long working at the grocery store during the day and at night I work as a cook at the college. They are slip resistant and hold up well for both jobs. Very happy with this purchase. Will buy these shoes again when they need to be replaced.
They are more comfortable then my previous pair from WalMart but still not real comfortable, I'm hoping they feel better after wearing them awhile.
Wear daily. Third pair. Highly recommended.
Great shoe! I'm on my second pair.
Daughter says that these are the best shoes for work yet! Works at Wendy's several hours a day.
Usually the first thing I(have to)do whenever buy a pair of shoes is &#34;remove the original insoles&#34; with a more expensive/comfortable pair. With these shoes,,that wasn't the case as after wearing them for a 12 hour shift proved to be as comfortable as those &#34;high priced insoles&#34;. Upon arrival the shoes DID have a dullness(shine wise)but after using my buff kit they look AWESOME. What more can you ask for,,,,comfort/professional appearance & at a price that's a steal. These are my first pair of Skechers but based on how comfortable these fit,I fully intend to check out others types.
Shoes fit well was happy with price and fit of the shoes would highly reccomend these shoes
Just run a bit small would have purchased 9.5 if I'd known.
Fits well. Would order again.
Great shoes! wear them to work
BooThang says they're the most comfortable shoes he's has to stand and work in all day.
Amazing shoes, very comfortable!
Fit perfect. Very comfortable.
good
I travel a lot on business and when I arrive at a destination I like to go places. Unless I'm on my way to a meeting, &#34;go places&#34; means I'm walking and using the public transportation. These shoes have a nice look that can be worn with business casual attire, so I find that I wear them almost everywhere.<br /><br />Because I sometimes forget to pack my running shoes or I don't have room to pack a third pair of shoes, I use these Skechers as my go-to gym and running shoes. The shoes weren't designed for running and it shows; however, the shoes offer enough support to run in them without discomfort and after using them as alternative running shoes for over a year, the durability becomes evident.<br /><br />All that said, I have had the pair I have for over one year and a half. I love my do-it-all shoes and just purchased a second pair to replace the pair I have. The first pair will be resigned to be my &#34;home improvement&#34; pair of shoes.
The shoes did not fit it's size and it is very uncomfortable.
Similar to city walk midnight (my favorite but cannot find 13W) but looks and feels bit cheap for the price.<br />Giving it a good rating simply because it fits well and is comfortable.
Love em compared to my other work shoes. These are light weight and agile.
These are very comfortable and are perfect if you work on hard surfaces all day. 10/10 would buy again.
I'm on my feet at work everyday and needed something that provided good cushion and support. These are really comfortable and wide for my feet so they have room to breathe. Would buy again.
Love the look, better than all the other shoes ive bought for work
They were as expected
Great shoe !!! The non slip grip works great so far and I am on my feet working 12 to 14 hours every day. No complaints at all !!!
Nice shoes. Unfortunately I bought extra wide size so I sent them back.
a little more rigid than the relaxed step sketchers I had previously, but maybe they will break in with a little use. fit and style were as expected. I certainly will buyh another pair of sketchers in the future, they have been my favorite casual shoe thus far.
Feels great , just like they all say , so I have another pair coming
Super comfortable and stylish
This is the second pair for my husband he loves them and wears to work every day. He used to wear crocks but sketchers seem to work better, more comfortable. He wore them out in 6 months, does not seem like a long time but better than other brands we had.
They fit is good but maybe skecher can make wide one because some people have wide foot
It's not as expected
I love these shoes they fits perfect
excellent work shoe very comfortable!!!!
A little bit smaller than the last pair
Hurt a bit at top of foot for the first day of use. Now broke in and feel great! I will see how well these shoes hold up in a kitchen.
The sole is very thin and hard, can even feel a pin on the ground.
Look great!  Might be a bit tight; but I think they just need to be broken in a bit.
I ordered these for the looks, but they are really comfortable too.  They are very slip resistant even on wet floors.  I would recommend these for anyone that wants a nice looking, comfortable shoe that can still resist slipping.
Finally a shoe that can be stylish and functional for work. Will buy it again
Too small !
I work in a hospital and am on my feet for 8-12 hour shifts, constantly moving. These shoes held up well for a few months, but were shot within about 8 months of wearing 3-4 days per week. The exterior wears down and freys, and they become very uncomfortable after a few hours of putting them on. My feet began to really hurt halfway through my shifts, and I was forced to purchase a new pair of shoes.<br /><br />For those that work in a setting like I do, go for something with a little bit more support for your feet. It is totally worth the money to just spring for a nicer pair of shoes.
I've had some foot troubles so hoping these help. I've only wore them for a week so hard to tell right now. Nice looking and fit really good. Need a little more support I think.
These are great shoes. This is my third pair and I am very happy with how comfy they are.
Had these with laces and liked them. These fit exact same and are just as comfortable. These are my new daily work shoes.
I think this is the most comfortable Skecher. It has a trendy look and is super durable. Other black leather shoes tend to scar when scuffed, this one doesn't somehow. After a year of heavy use it still looks very good. Skecher's 'Diameter' is slightly better looking, but comes with a weird 2-level heel pad. The Rockland doesn't which I think feels better.  The Rockland-Hooper is the &#34;Skechers for Work&#34; line...and isn't available in any of my stores for some reason though. The large Skecher Outlet at my local mall was puzzled too, and didn't even know what it was. I like to try on shoes before I buy them so I find it odd that Skecher doesn't sell these through normal retail channels...which is why I only give it a 4.
They are simply too small. I usually wear size 9 or sometimes (when it comes to work shoes) 9.5.<br />At first I bought size 9 but they were too small so I thought 9.5 would have been just right but comes out they are still too small, very similar to size 9. I'm just too tired of returning them to buy a bigger size, but I should have bought size 10 and it's ridiculous cause it's like 2 sizes more than I usually wear.<br />I'll stick with size 9.5 until my feet get too tired of working with these shoes.<br />First and last time I buy shoes online.
Extremely satisfied with fit. It's an immediately wearable shoe.
Very light and comfortable, on my feet all day and no complaints, also very slip resistant.
Nice shoes. Stylish for working.
Bought them for my husband really likes them, size was good but a bit tight on him he's trying to break them in
Husband hasn't complained yet. Good price so had to give them a try
The right boot fits tighter across the top of my foot than the left one.
Really good boots!
I wear these all day at work on construction sites.  They are very comfortable, easy to slip on, and very durable!  The price was amazing and the product is the same quality I've come to expect from Skechers!
A little larger than expected but not enough to return them. Other than that, they're great. Very comfortable.
Great boot for work in the Navy, super comfortable considering I wear them for at least 16 hours a day.  The only grip I have is the soles are not oil/slip resistant, that would have made them a dream come true.
Relaxed fit is a bit sloppy even for my husband who has wide feet.  Added inserts that have helped.  Top of the boot rubbed against his shin causing a rub mark. Hopefully they break in.
really surprised how much he likes these boots
I ordered a pair of these work boots for my husband.  He's only ware them 4 times to work . And already the boot is starting to tear on the sides of the boots. I myself don't understand why they would be tearing already just after 4days of wearing them.
This boots a little weird.. To put them on are too small but once you pull and pull for about 30 minutes after they're too big.!! The neck of the boot is too small but the shoe it self is too big.. I'm size 9.5 but the shoe itself feels like a size 10
stiff upper other than that great boot it will soften in time I know great boot great price
They are a little large, but a pair of gel inserts and perfect
For the price they were an excellent choice
Not gonna get a better boot for the price
Great product I'll buy it again
Nice but to large
These run 1-1.5sizes big!!!!  Order AT LEAST 1 size smaller than normal...they are OK...the toe is really tall which give them a bit of a Herman Munster look and the stack is a bit big which catches your pant leg...still breaking them in with thick socks- hoping they'll quit sliding my socks down when they break in.
These were for a father's day gift. He was pleased with them. He wore them all day walking around property and didn't complain that they were uncomfortable. I've always purchased him the Wellington boots, but I think we have a new brand.
Comfort boot. Thumbs up.
great boots for the money!!!
Fits big . Especially big around widest part of foot. Quality seems good, except fit.
Have used these for about a month now. Overal they seem like decent boots... If they actually fit you. These run at least a size too big and probably consider them a wide also. Unfortunately I normally wear a 7 in men's and these are huge. These feel more like a 8 or 8.5 wide. My feet swim in these, I added a insole which makes them bearable. I will not be ordering them again.
Great boots. After reading the reviews on sizing, I wear an 11, so I ordered a 10 1/2, and they are perfect.
I like these, would like them better if they were not steel toes
They were nice boots, but they were to big.  Sent them back and got the next size smaller.
at least two sizes too big
I normally wear a 9.5 regular. Ordered a 9 based off others reviews and they are right they run big. These fit me like my old worn out 9.5. Like them so far
The boots fit a little large & I am prohibited from wearing steel toe boots which the discription failed to note or I overlooked when I reviewed the purchase.
Bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. He calls them &#34;sock thieves&#34; though. :-) He says until you wear them in a bit, they will pull your socks down a little bit throughout the day. These run just slightly large, but that was what I had hoped for. He has slightly wide feet and I was trying to find boots that were the style he wanted but also wide and this was the best I could find. If you have narrow feet, I would not recommend these.
I've been wearing these attics water plant for the last 5 weeks and these are the most comfortable boots I've had in a long time I'm on my feet walking on cement 8 hours a day and standing for four they're very comfortable Zelda slip-resistant see in a slaughterhouse is just adequate
Good affordable work boot.
Great boot for the price.
Was not immediately comfortable like my first two pairs of Shape-ups. But once broken in, they are great. I work 8-10 hours on a concrete floor and my feet don't hurt anymore. Very well cushioned.
My husband is a custodian and has that are company bought uncomfortable.  He was always complaining about his feet hurting. He is a prior owner of these shoes and never complained about his feet when wearing them.  I bought these shoes to replace them and he is all good!  Thanks for fast delivery and a great price AMAZON PRIME!! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SDS2WBG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br />https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/412H45YLeGL._SS300_.jpg
I need a pair of these white a composit tie in it thanks
Before I use this shoe but this one is not comfortable .if I am use this shoe I have pain my ancel .and finger and foot also
Excellent
Feels tight when you first put them on but once walking around it feels snug fit and easy to go faster walking as well. Just need to use thin style socks. Thanks, Anesh.
Best work shoe I have ever worn. Feet and legs feel great after nine hours.
Fit good could be a little wider, should be ok after break in.
Very comfortable shoe feels great I'm on my feet all day
Very comfortable shoe well worth the cost some more arch support would be good
great. a little pricy
I wear these Skechers at work.
I've worn these for years and like them a GREAT DEAL. They are comfortable and very durable.
Fast delivery and just as described.
Great comfort!
Great
Been wearing this style as bartending shoes for years.... only thing that saves my legs & feet! LOVE THEM! I do try to buy wide fit when I can find them, just helps with swollen feet after multi10+hr shifts in a row!
Love them
These used to have soft cushy soles that felt like you were walking on air.  Very disappointing.  My feet are killing me
My new sketchers shape up work shoes look, fit and feel the same as<br />my old sketchers.Going to save my new ones until I can't walk on<br />my old ones anymore.<br />  VERY HAPPY
Very happy. These shoes really do what I need them to do, cushion, shock absorb, so I can walk, stand, ect.
Very uncomfortable!!  Had them on for only a couple minutes and the safety toe was digging into my foot causing pain. Will be returning. Love Amazon for a great return policy.
I love them
Fits as expected
Most comfortable shoes I've ever had for work
The best work shoes that I have bought in years. Extremely comfortable, I don't mind being on my feet for 9 hours everyday in these shoes. I have a very high arch and the wide width gives me a great fit. And a great bonus, a composite toe! I love these shoes.
My husband has to have steel toe for work and I bought him these and he loves them!!  I ask everyday how his feet are and he says &#34;great!&#34;
Great protection. I work with pallets and their trucks daily at work. The composite toes have paid for themselves many times over. Comfortable and sized correctly. If the toes are tight google heel lock.  Makes the shoes much more comfortable.
Very comfortable, roomy and light.
Light weight.  Fit like sneakers but have the protection of composite toe for work use.  Great alternative to steel toe work boots!
Junk, 4 days of work and there already ripping at the seam and memory foam inner sole is pulling apart,would love a Refund
Very comfortable, but only got 6 months of use out of them.  Still ok for use, but must have nice shoes for manager job.  I did buy the same shoe to replace them.
I think they will be fine after I break them in.
Hubby loved these!!!!!
Happy with purchase<br />Good points:<br />- Comfortable<br />- Look good<br />Bad points:<br />- Warm in summer<br />- On the heavy side.  I thought a composite toe boot would be lighter than steel toe boot
I have been purchasing the Skecher Blueridge work shoes/ steel toe. these are even better so far and far more comfortable IMO...
10,000% improvement over the Caterpillar boots they replaced. 10/10, will buy again.
So far so good . It's been a week
Extremely comfortable and sturdy, I've seen a few negative reviews but I'm satisfied with mine. The memory foam makes them very comfortable and the composite toe is not heavy at all, I would definitely buy them again.
they are more like a 9.5 than a 8.5 so they are a little sloppy with way too flat of a heal
Bought these for my husband as work shoes.  First pair were way too small, had to return for the larger size.  He started wearing these in February and by May they were worn out.  The upper part of the shoe is falling apart.  Too late to return.  For the price they should have lasted longer.  They are a rip off.  Do not buy these.
the shoes are close to perfect. well im 8.5 but the shoes seem be 8.8 or something. when i walk my foot moves on the inside of the shoes. which is causing my toes to grind against the side of the shoe. the shoe on the left has a crease feels uncomfortable than the one on the right. its like a line that didn't get sufficient foam/ stuffing like the one on the right. hope this makes sense. but overall i really like the shoes. im gonna try putting a piece of cloth over that expose area where is missing that foam protection. because i think that the composite toe didn't get fully cover. by the stitches.
Would purchase again!!!!!!!
to small narrow in toe box
Very comfortable shoe I work in road construction and do a lot of work sometime these shoes are light work and real easy to work in will buy them again it's hard to find good work shoes
These work shoes are very comfortable
My husband has no complaints.
So far, excellent work boots, I wear them +10hrs/day and they are really comfortable, amazingly lightweight btw. Fit as expected.
This review will be a little unfair, because I didn't take a single step in these shoes. I sat down and tried one on, and the composite toe dug into my feet, so I put it right back in the box and returned the pair. They were a great looking pair of shoes, so I was really disappointed about the composite toe being so tight, especially on shoes that were a size EEE wide. I ordered them extra wide like that just to not have to worry about the toe, but alas - the toe pinched anyway.<br /><br />They looked better than I expected from the pictures, and I so wanted them to work. Live and learn, I guess, and steel or composite toes are just not going to work for me.
I have a normal width foot and these were a little wide for me, the toe box is a lot more comfortable than other comp. toe shoes I have had but it makes them feel like your wearing clown shoes, otherwise they are comfortable enough to live with.
A lot lighter then I thought they would be. I wish they breathed a little better but over all, espically for a composite toe boot, these are awesome. Super comphy as well. My feet feel better after work then they have in a long time!!
I need to return them and get a pair wider in the toe
Got some discomfort with my little toe right about where the composite material starts. Soles are not that comfortable either. Also after about just six wears there is tear in the leather on the outer side of the right foot. I would have sent it back if i had not dyed it black to match uniform code.
These have steel toes, not in the discription.
shoes fit as they should, shipped fast.
Very comfortable and for once a pair of work shoes with enough padding in the soles that a gel sole insert is not necessary.  I have only worn these for about two weeks.  I am thinking the sole padding may be a problem as the shoe wears but only time will tell.  Very comfortable and not heavy for work shoes. For work shoes they keep my feet relatively cool and they look great.
I have always had good luck with Skechers
Its comfortable to wear after putting extra insole. No problem with the traction.
Red Wing WOULD be the shoe I would get because I like composite toe/shank and the Red Wing Worx 5021 was the perfect shoe for me. King/Big toe box, composite and $100 bucks a pair. Would last like 6-8 months WITH Red Wing heat mold-able inserts (that are like $45-60 a pair) for REAL good ARCH support. They quit making those shoes. I got stuck with 1 pair of $140 too big (10.4 H/4E) Red Wing shoes and a 11 2E Worx Sneaker w/composite toe. Anyway THEY SUCK. I got these, I DID get them in 11 3E even thou the foot sizing machine at the Red Wing store says 10.5 3E, I just KNOW that buying shoes WITHOUT trying them on makes for a real s***ty day....<br />These are OK, NOT the best. If you need (like me 10.5) and you get with composite toe, get a HALF SIZE BIGGER. It never fails that one brand shoe is NOT the same size as another brand.<br />Also this, and THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT thing....<br />NEVER EVER buy shoes from Amazon or ANY online store that does NOT have FREE RETURNS FREE SHIPPING<br />I mean, it's just STUPID to buy something from a picture without this<br />I am RETURNING the other pair of Skechers I got from Amazon, they just don't feel right in the toe box, even at size 11 3E<br />I need a king/big toe box (and any steel toe/composite toe box does NOT give like a regular shoe does).
I like the shoes...
The memory foam is feels amazing and the composite toe keeps them lightweight and easy to wear all day.
My son likes them and they were cheaper than any of the store in my area.
These shoes could possibly be the most comfortable work shoes I ever put on<br />First day on my feet. No break in. Feet did not hurt when the day was over. I was completely surprised and satisfied. I will definitely buy another pair. Now to see how well they hold up<br />Will update later
Bought them for my husband on-line because no one carried them in store & they fit him perfect! He loves the memory foam!
Overall what I expected. Just seem narrow for and extra wide.
Great shoe, good price.
excellent
perfect
I always get size 12 shoes, these feel like 12 and 1/2. Way too big of shoe i work as a bar manager and after of 9 hours of work my feet were killing me with these shoes.
Frist time buy somgthing from  Usamazon,it is very good! I hope Increase goods send to china!
Very good .it's great
very nice
great fit he happy im happy thx deb
This shoe does not have a composite toe.
They're super comfortable,I work 8 hours and literally feels like I only worked for a hour no sore feet,literally feel a little bit taller too ahaha,and it's breathable ,feet don't smell at the end of the day,so far so good I like them
Great
Good shoes.
Tight in the toes and yet the heel was loose. I have been wearing Sketchers for years, these did not fit right to me.
good shoes, suit for work
Needed some new work shoes and these are perfect. Very comfortable. I put no on good arch support, but I have a condition that requires me to wear specially made orthotics, so technically no shoe I buy has good arch support. Otherwise, I would recommend this purchase.
Excellent for work .........
I LIKE THESE SNEAKERS BUT WHEN I FIRST PUT THEM ON I NOTICED IT WAS A TIGHTER FIT THEN EXPECTED. I THINK THIS WAS MOSTLY DUE TO THE NARROW WIDTH SIZE. NORMALLY WHEN I BUY MY SKETCHERS I ALWAYS LOOK FOR WIDE WIDTH SNEAKERS, I THOUGHT THESE WERE WIDE BUT I WAS WRONG. SKETCHERS PLEASE OFFICIALLY MAKE ALL YOU MEN SNEAKERS WIDE THEY ARE FAR MORE COMFORTABLE THAN REGULAR WIDTH SNEAKERS.
Good shoes, comfortable all day long!!!
Seem to fit ok, a little narrow but not bad.
I had to put gel insoles in them. The quality is high, they have lasted longer than other steel toe shoes I've purchased in the past.
I actually thought this was the best pair of skechers work shoes I have ever purchased.  I am hard on shoes working in an automotive repair facility, and I go through shoes like crazy. I never have liked the skechers in the past because they would wear out so quickly, the soles would come off of the old shoes and the inside of the shoe would wear down quickly at my toes.  But these shoes were different than all the rest.  Even though they are worn out now they lasted longer then any.  In fact my wife bought me a new pair of New Balance shoes, she even special ordered them and didn't ask me if I wanted them because she was trying to be nice.  These shoes have worn out already, only after three months (if that).  So, I find myself about to order a new pair of these skechers and much to my surprise the price went up from $51 to $79.  Kind of bummed out about that to be honest with you.  I might go check Academy sports to see if they have them in stock because I know they carry these exact shoes.
Very comfortable work shoes and much less expensive than buying in a store. And they're no heavier than a good, solid sneaker, even with the steel toe.
Comfortable shoes but not tough enough for someone hard on shoes like me.
They're awesome except for the insole which I changed but all in all they are fantastic I highly recommend them. I walked in real muddy and very wet conditions and my feet stayed dry numerous times. They are very comfortable. *****
Good
Light and great protection.
My husband had a somewhat similar pair of Sketchers that he just wore out over the years.  We hesitantly bought these online, as he normally spends an hour or so trying on shoes in stores.  These fit exactly like the previous pair and he wears them for work and play.
5 star
Good fit.
Nice comfortable work shoes
I work at the port, so steel toes are mandatory. I love Skechers because it's one of the few brands that offer extra wide sizes. And more importantly they're budget friendly compared to other steel toed boots.
little tight but well made
Good non slip thick soles.  I got 13 wide though and the steel toe pinches a bit I had to take turns with my other shoes for about 2 weeks before my toes calloused up enough to be comfy.
This shoes lasted me 4 months. After the 3 week of wearing them the seams in front started to tear.its ashamed that sketchers cant seem to be able to fix this problem. Other than that they are very comfortable.
Great product love these shoes
Very comfortable but only lasted 2 months<br />I work on the back of garbage truck and it is very hard on shoes but 2 months? Not worth 80 bucks
Perfect for what I was looking for.  Just have to wait and see how well they hold up!
I bought these hoping they would be a good fit and they were,, but until they come down in price I wont be buying anymore.
Very nice looking shoe but unless you have a very narrow foot make sure to buy wide size. The safety toe is very uncomfortable if you don't since it will rub against your toes. Also unlike non safety toe shoes they do not break in.
Comfortable right out of the box. Wore them at work all day and feet felt great.
great
Defect in right heal felt like walking on a nail. It was not in the removal insole pad and no evidence of any thing under insole. could not wear shoes.<br />Disappointed.
Great Work Shoe!  I have had to wear steal toe shoes for over 5 years now and these are by far the most comfortable pair I have ever had. I will buy these again - hope when I do I can find my size in BLACK - but this color is just fine for work.
Overall shoes were comfortable, but the toe portion starts to get a bit uncomfortable after several hours of wear. Fits as expected. Good quality.
Hold up well.
Great shoes, very pleased!
It really helps my husbands ankle and legs<br />I would highly recommend them to any who needs to wear work boots who have back and leg problems!!!
It feel good,
bought them 16 months ago.... bought them again. They are my daily wear shoes at my warehouse job. Many miles of wear on the original pair and I only replaced them because the top rear of the heel was frayed and a little torn.
A very good shoe at an affordable price!
excellent
I needed a good work/casual shoe.  This shoe works for that.  I like the fit, however this is a heavy shoe, if not for that I would love it vs. like it.
Sketchers really cut corners on these cheaply made and poorly designed shoes. They designed the shoe with no padding between the steel toe and your foot and the steel toe cap has a ~1/16&#34; ridge running along the entire inside radius of the trailing edge which digs into your toes and the sides of your feet. You'll feel the ridge as soon as you put the shoes on and after a short period the pain will make you take them off. This is not a sizing issue. The shoes fit perfectly. They are not tight in any area but are snug enough to prevent any foot movement. How low does one's IQ have to be to design a toe cap with a ridge running along the inside edge? These are not cheap at $80+ so this was the last thing I expected and they are going back today!  PS - Don't be misled by the good reviews. If you read them carefully it will be obvious to you that the review is not of this specific product. For example one 5 star review&#34; Best Work &#34;Boot&#34; I've Ever Owned&#34; says &#34;I always get the black ones&#34; but these are not available in black. I'm sure he's reviewing Sketchers, just not this model. Only two of the 5 star revues are verified purchases.
I love these shoes.  I use them at work where steel toes are required.  They are light but still rugged enough for hard work and lots of walking on cement floors.
Great saftey shoes make my second pair over the 3 year of wearing them.
The color is different from the color requested. I do not like that color :(.<br />The size if I expected!!!
Shoes where good, once insoles where put in..
Fit is good.Had to add inserts for better arch support. Could have better ventilation to let your foot breath, they get warm but not as bad  as my boots.
Perhaps it's just me and my particular feet, but I wear a 9E in everything else.  These in 9E, it feels like the steel toe is not wide enough, and the shoes are thus causing swelling on my outer toes.  If not for that, these would be great.
Could have used a little more inner padding or put a gel insert.
Had them going on two weeks now, orderd a size 10 E ( wide)  fits good  still breaking them in  on my feet most of the time
I'm not in to steel toes but they're comfortable
Great product, fast shipping.
Very good shoes all around.<br /><br />Nice, springy step, good feel, accurate sizing, seemingly well constructed.
AM returning them because they are to narrow in the toe and they pinch my toes.
Shoe was a lot nicer than I expected! Someone took a lot of time to design and make all the features this shoe offers. Great looking and super strong and sturdy, but most of all it is very comfortable after wearing it for endless hours. Big thumbs up!
Wow, not even close to the fit. Had to return.
Very comfortable work shoes - size is exact.
If you need a heavy duty work shoe, this is perfect. Under $27.00 quality seems flawless, steel toe,a bit on the heavy side yet much lighter than a boot.
Confortable but in the third week of work, the leather like fabric in the outer part of the shoe broke, you cannot see the foot because there is a second layer of fabric, but the outer one broke. I used it in the construction site i work.
Very nice show but its supposed to be a triple E which is extra wide and it is not. Its very narrow.
read the reviews but went with them anyway because I love my other Skeckers.  NOT for people that have wide feet.  Bought  1/2 size bigger to allow for the steel toe comfort.  still too narrow.  Thought I would spend the extra $ for comfort but it bit me in the 6.  They are heavy.  Can't wait to go back to my $38.00 Walmart Steel toe boots again.
Fit great and don't hurt me feet
These shoes are great. I wear them to work everyday. For working shoes I do like my sneakers abit bigger. I am a female that wears size 8.5.and as these are mens shoes So I got size 7 and they are perfect. I would recommend these any day. Soft on my feet for all day wear.i work 10hrs a day 5 days a wk.
I bought these on sale much cheaper than my other work shoes. They could use a little a little more cushioning but so far<br />I have been able to wear them all day without any orthotics inside. They seem somewhat lighter than my other work shoes.<br />All in all, well worth what I gave for them.
The skechers fits somewhat ok., but it's little narrow and somewhat large. I should have ordered 10.5 wide. When I first worn the skechers, it had a metal or sharp object protruding form the inside( it's part of the steel toe).
Your feet will feel achy the first day or so. But once they start breaking in, they feel pretty comfortable. The steel toe feels very strong. I also like the slip resistance since I work at an auto repair shop. I also prefer the feel and style of a sneaker than a work boot. Hopefully these can hold up to the abuse I put my last pair of Timberland Steel-Toe Sneakers.
excellent shoes , as described , thanks for the fast delivery and excellent service
I'm looking for a comfortable work shoe that I can wear all day and this was not the one. Unless someone mislabeled the shoe, it felt like a regular shoe with no padding on the inside. You will need some kind of insole for comfort.
Bought for husband.. fit perfect! Amazing price for an amazing shoe.
Orderd these a 1/2 size larger and they fit good the steel toe puts some pressure on my right pinky toe till they were broken in had to get some work dr. Shouls inserts the shoes are hard much better with the insoles thought I was getting a good deal for $30 but had to buy some good $20 insoles so they quickly turned into $50 shoes I just hope they last.
Second pair, first lasted a year or so working in a tool shop. Little heavy, but steel toed, so........
My husband loves these Sketchers. They are comfortable all day on his feet.
These shoes are great.  I put in my own foot beds for added arch suppor, but I do this with all my shoes.  Much more comfortable than the extra wide steel tow boots I own.
I'm all smiles.
too narrow for the size.
Best quality products you can get in this price range
EXCELLENT
This shoe is a little small for the size but will be ok to wear. They could use a little more confront around the toe area.
Since the shoes have a steel toe I expect it to take a while for the shoes to be broken in completely
I tried just one shoe and put it back in the box .I have a pair of  scheckers sneakers size 10d and they fit fine, maybe even a little  large.I tried to respond about the size issue when I was asked to reply about  about the packaging.So while I was waiting, I just bought anothe pair of scheckers work shoes 1/2 size bigger just today although a different style.Is theye any way that I can return the small ones and get a credit on my account. Thanks Bob Thompson
I bought these for my husband. One of the shoes had a lump in the shoe at the arch. The company would not let me return the shoe because my husband wore the shoes hoping that all he needed was to break them in. I have had to spend more money to buy a different pair of shoes and had to throw away a new pair of shoes.
Good work shoe
The Sketchers work shoes are awesome!!  I stand & walk on concrete floors all day. In my old shoes my feet would be so worn out. In my new Sketchers Work shoes my feet feel so much better.
I purchased these for my husband, and he loved them. He used them for work all the time, said they were very comfortable! The only thing wrong was he wore them out to quickly. He already needs a new pair. I would definetly purchase them again.
A+++
I give it 3 stars because I got very good deal. But the steel toe is uncomfortable.
These safety shoes are not boots, but these shoes are still very good and comfortable, providing very good toe protection.
Excellent
Great work shoes, very comfortable
The appearance of the shoe is fine, however the fit could be a little bit more relaxed ! They are very snug and although new, they made my feet almost sore by the end of my work day.
Amazing,I love it!!!!
Good looking shoes, just to small in the front with the steel toe, needed the larger size. Got those and they seem to fit well and are comfortable so far. For the price I think they will be a good shoe and I like the way they look.
I have one problem with these shoes. The toe covers wore of in one day of wearing them. however I do like them.
Shoes fit well. A little on the heavy side. You will gain about an inch in height. Takes a while to break them in.
Fit is ok, but after a few hours , I can feel the solid toe protection around my toes? Wish it was just a bit wider there.
They are not 3e just extra wide they ate too small
For the price you can't beat these shoes, they are very sturdy, and very comfortable.  I did have to buy some insoles, because my feet are a little wide for the shoe.
a very uncomfortable shoe I'm trying my best to break it in.<br />very unhappy with this shoe.<br />I brought 3 others pairs without the steel toe and I love those shoes very much.
I needed a steel toe shoe because I'm moving heavy equipment around at work.  I'm budget minded and for the price these shoes fit the bill nicely.  I don't know if it's the shoe or the position of my little toe, but on my right foot my pinky toe sits just outside of and on the edge of the steel toe cup.  It's irritating bumping it all day and the leather isn't stiff enough to keep my toe within the opening of the cup.  They felt a little odd at first, but after wearing them around the house a couple days to break them in they felt a little better.  They are definitely more of a steel toe shoe than a work boot though.
When I first put them on I was afraid that there was not enough arch support. As I wore them 12 hours and throughout the day the support was there and were very comfortable. (I just had to break them in.) I usually wear the 6&#34; boot version so I had to get used to the feel of the shoe not tied for support around the ankle. I would recommend them and I hope this description helps. I do not buy shoes on line but the price was incredible.
Great buy thanks
My son said they are perfect, happy with them. I
excellent shoes, perfect fit
I have a pair of U.S. size 12/medium width and they are wider than this pair I just purchased. Which are marked 12 Ex Wide. This leads me to believe that they are not the size as marked or there is extra material in the toes that shouldn't be there?
I have just had foot surgery and my one foot that was worked on swells during the day. Most of the time I need a work shoe with ankle support and go with a higher steeltoed shoe but the higher shoe ended up rubbing on my ankle that has been sore and swollen and bought these for those times! They are plenty wide, attractive, and feel good on my feet. They have the steel toe so my feet are protected at the foundry that I work in. They are a very sturdy shoe and well made. I'm very glad that I bought them and they really took care of the early problems I have had with my foot recovering but will wear them in the future with no pain once I have finished recovering. They are a great work sneaker and highly recommend them to anyone that would prefer to wear a steel toed shoe rather that a steel toed boot made of leather that doesn't have any give or is able to breathe! I love them!
Nice fitting shoe!
i recieved my second pair and they fit great. the first pair i ordered the wrong size.
They could  be a  little bit
Love this pair of shoes. I am very happy they come in extra wide width.
Good fit
Probably should have ordered 1/2 size larger but they are alright, I think they will work out fine once they are broken in.
Best work shoe ever!!
I had them stretched ,now they are good...
good shoe
excelente producto
Awesome shoes
very uncomfortable
lasted 5 months
Don't waste your money. Save your self from the pain
Shoes are comfortable and arrived on time.
My only complaint is that the sizes run a tad small. Besides that, this is pretty good footwear.
Most comfortable work shoes I own.Work very well in dealing with Plantar Fasciitis.
They are a bit large but give my toes plenty of room to move. Exactly what i whanted, im going to order another pair.
Great value
great work shoes if you dislike bulky painful steel toed boots. Fit and feel like tennis shoes, but with steel toe......very comfortable all day, to walk with and even run in (for short bursts)
very well
There ok but when i tried to thight them up it rips but i fixed
I used once for a few hours and my little toes start bleeding
Not as comfortable as I expected from this brand. Feet were sore after wearing for 6 hours.
good boot as advertised i should of ordered the wider size cause with the steel toe these boots are tight,
I should of gotten 12.5 or 13. With the steel toe maybe uses foot room. Otherwise very nice boot.
b
Great value!! Comfortable from the first day! Wore over 8 hours in a factory first day and no problems with feet.
Very nice but heavy.
good comfortable work shoe. No break in period
Great comfort as well as safe.
Dan good shoe for the money. Apt more comfortable than  shies twice the price.
Love them
Very comfortable shoe at a great price. Order came quickly, well done!!!!
Bought these to replace a pair of worn out Skechers for work shoes. The other pair is very similar. The other pair is an extra-wide width and these didn't seem as wide as my previous pair. However, the box they were in just said wide not extra-wide.  I think the padded insert in the shoe has gone down in quality, but the pair I replaced was almost 5 years old. Almost everything has gone down in quality. I purchased the exact same size and width as the other pair and comparing the two I would say the new pair is noticeably (about an inch/inch and a half) shorter in length then the old pair when measuring heel to heel and visually and in feel not quite as wide.
Great work shoe.
To small
Love them
Good FIT Happy feet
Good
Wasn't wide enough
Tread pattern on shoes is terrific for picking-up rock and dirt.  Also terrific for picking-up ice-melt/rock salt on sidewalks.  Sole is stiff and hard resulting in walking noise when cold.
First day the insoles  started coming apart. Not as comfortable as advertised. Somewhat heavy.
Best work shoe's i've ever owned. Most comfortable and best slip resestent shoe I have wore.
inside soles are curling up, day 31 cannot return. shame on you amazon.  i'm cancelling my prime membership
If these shoes hold up over time, I will order again. They are a little heavier than my last shoe but the support and comfort make up for that.
This is the most comfortable work shoe I have ever worn, the arch support was very good. I work in and manage a bus repair shop and never had any problems with slipping on wet and oily floors. I would have given this shoe 5 + stars if the padding inside of the shoe had not started coming apart after the third week.
These are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever had, the toe cap digs into the top of my foot with every step. I had a trade show to do over in Europe and they gave me hell the whole time. I wish I could give them no stars. DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES!!!!!!!!
Shoe is very comfortable. And looks great!
Great fit and good arch support . thank you
but looks taller then it is
I expected these to be good for standing around in all day with the memory foam inside, but when I got them I realised the memory foam was only on the heel of the sole. The rest of the sole is just hard. Had to buy a replacement sole really soon after since my job requires me to stand all day.
Thank you
Have only had them a week but so far so good. They Are comfy and fit perfect. I recommend these shoes so far. Especially for people that work in restaurants and are on there feet all day
To in the heel to large it was the wrong shoes not the one I order I dont  like the way the shoe is made bad for me
My second pair came without the removable insole, so I had to use the one from my first pair. They are very comfortable but don't last to long. (like 6 months if used every day). I am about to order my third pair, they are ok for the money.
They are amazingly comfortable. No more pain in lower back as I work standing.
only had for 2 months and ripped
I am on my feet 10 hrs a day at my job, my feet don't get tired at all I love these sketchers, I have no trouble with them, thank you Amazon!!!!
Just what my husband needed!  Looking for a shoe that is comfortable for work and walking all day this is it.  Style and comfort!
Best one ðŸŒ¹
i like this and i will try buy
Best deal
Excellent product -
Just excelent.
Great product
These are awesome!!!  The insole is very comfortably padded.  I have very flat feet with knee and hip problems and walk all day long.  Since I started wearing these, I have stopped using my orthotic insoles and have less pain and more comfort!!  From now on, Skechers are my shoe of choice!!!
i didnt buy for the arch support because i have to buy supports all my shoes even the ones that say arch support. i just like the thick  shoe sole. the shoe arch support is a little hard for me...i have flat feet.
Ok shoe, not a comfortable as another different style from sketchers I had ,not sure if they had a wide version but I think I should have checked that first as that is what I need..... Oh well gunna wear them out anyway,   Update, I've had them maybe a month they blew out in the front toe part, almost twisted an ankle, I would not call these a work shoe.
Perfect fit highly recommend
Great quality and comfortable to wear all day.
Bought these for my 80 year old dad whos feet hurt going to costco ect. He says that his feet no longer hurt. He plans on taking them on a cruise vacation.  They are light weight not a heavy shoe.
I couldn't wear it because it was large and i hate this kind of shoes!!
I'm very disappointed about this shoes , are heavy  and no memory foam or wherever i want my money back
A bit more arch & would be perfect. So far, I can wear them about 8-10 hours before my feet feel tired & I stand most of that time on anti fatigue matting 9/16&#34; thick.
Love them so smooth
One of the best shoes to wear all day .
Good working shoes
Very nice, thanks
Nice shoes just what i needed
A quality shoe is worth it's weight everytime.
Very nice comfortable shoe
Very sloppy loose fit which I think is weird for slip-ons. These shoes felt as if they would come off my foot. It seems like Skechers is very invested in this relaxed fit which means I won't be buying skechers.
These were slightly big for my husband who normally wears a 13, but since there is no 12.5  available he chose to keep them.
This shoe was not as comfortable as advertised. It actually caused me to have foot and ankle issues.
Comfortable and slip resistant...just what I need.
Fit perfectly in my foot, nice shape, light weight<br />7 days of direct international shipping.<br /><br />Really Sketchers deserve the Five Stars.<br /><br />Excellent seller.
My husband really likes these shoes.  He forgets they're his work shoes and wears them everywhere.
After wearing these for a couple of weeks the balls of my feet hurt constantly. Pain went away after not wearing them for a month.
Is very comfortable to wear.<br />The quality of a material of leather shoes looks is not so good in the picture.
Great Shoes!!!!! They fit very nice and are super comfortable.
Still breaking them in. But no problems for now. Very light shoes. Comfortable.
I couldn't more satisfied with the shoes. You will experience mild discomfort for a day or two, until the memory foam settles, but after that the shoes become perfectly comfortable. They are truly no slip, except on very wet tiles, but even then they slip very little. I would recommend them to anyone that spends a lot of time on their feet.
Great
Very comfy shoes but extremely low quality leather. It had cracks within the first week of wearing/12-14 hours a day/
These shoes are awesome. I'm on my feet 12 hrs a day. Look and feel great!
My husband absolutely  loves these shoes<br /> Will definitely  purchase again
good job
have some problems in side the shoe
Bought these as replacement and moved My Dr. Shoells arch supports into.
It fit perfect I am please with my purchase.
excellent
This shoes does the job well done
Fit as expected soft and confortable
I'm a mechanic on my feet all day, they are comfortable
Great shoes, memory foam insole feels great!!
Used it for few weeks now, and It is still comfortable<br />the only problem is that is stinks at the end of the day,,,, but kind of all leather work shoes. still didn't find the one that won't.
Hard not comfortable and low quality leather
Love them
Bought these for my son about 9 months ago. He works a minimum of 50 hours a week as a server in a very busy restaurant, so he is constantly on his feet. These shoes are comfortable and have held up great. My son has wide feet and has tried other shoes. This is a second purchase. Definitely recommend.
as promised and delivered on time
I've had four previous pairs of sketchers and loved them from the moment I put them on. But this pair is uncomfortable. It doesn't have the padding that I am used to. I think they took out half the material and then made up a fancy term for it &#34;Memory Foam&#34;. I also don't like that they stamp their brand on the exposed part of the tongue as it cheapens the look. I always thought I had found the shoe for the rest of my life but now I have to start looking at other brands.
They look great and feel great, but they last maybe 2 months before falling apart.
Comfortable. Nice looking too.
Bought these shoes for my husband who works 8-12 hour shifts in the factory. He loves them. No complaints. Works just as good as his $100+ shoes.
Good fit! Very comfortable.
Bought these for my husband to work in<br />He's very satisfied with the quality of this boot.He would buy another pair!!!!
good boots for the price
Nice
Good boot! Was sent steel toes, so I returned.
Sent to my brother who is a truck driver and he said they were very comfortable and he is out 12-16 hours at a time.  Holding up good so far as well.
After first wearing, speed lace grommet fell out.
It's to large and steel toe wanted soft toe will send it back
They are awesome real nice
Good boots for the money.  Comfortable and seem to be well built.  I ordered a half size smaller than i regularly wear and they fit perfect.
i shouid buy size 8 so 8.5 is too big
These boots are durable and comfortable. An amazing product at a great price. I'm very satisfied.
haihaola
Can't beat the price.  Wear 2 pairs of socks for the first 80-100 hours of wearing. The steel toe isn't that bad.
Ordered a size small and they are still too large across the top of the foot,
Good shoe
1.a little bit large. 2.it can keep my foot warm like my keen boots, which is twice more expensive than this. 3.I can wear it all day long without any uncomfortable.
Not bad.But it's somewhat large,so I gave it to others who  fit that.
Very nice work boots.
great fit, low price for quality leather and steel toe, fast shipping!
Decent boot
Fit as expected and gift recipient likes them.
as a mechanic I am on my feet all day.  These boots are comfortable and lightweight.
Nice
Awesome work boot! Better than expected!
They fit half size bigger. Which was fine since I use insoles. Stitching looks well made
Very good work boot
Too loose in the heal / ankle area not enough support. Sorry to say I will be sending them back.
Love these boots! Skechers rock!
The boots were awesome they fit good they are very comfortable with the memory foam. The boots are steel toe I expected them to be heavy on my feet but they are actually a very light boot. Good work boots.
Hubby loves these boots! works long hours and says his feet feel great!
Great shoe but I wish they make another design
I'm so happy with this shoes they are so countable I spent over 100 dollar in difference shoes and they sock but this are the best I ever had
I like it a lot
No complains from my husband. We wears size 10. Very comfortable he said. Fit great. Got in great price too!
I'm on my feet all day, although a 1/2 to a whole size larger these very roomy shoes are very comfy with the memory foam insoles.
for sitting or driving not for extended waulking
Well worth the money!
Good shoe that handles all the crap that I walk through.
Beat deal ever
I previously had the more expensive Skechers &#34;Solace&#34; model, which I've worn and put through heavy use since the middle of 2013. I saw that these were quite similar and less expensive, so I went with them for a replacement, going for the same 10.5 size.<br /><br />The 10.5 size is just too large, mostly due to their design. The Solaces and these are both slip-ons, but the former has some mesh and padding in the back to help with fit. This model slid up and down my heel as I walked, so I exchanged them for the 10s, which had the same problem, though not as badly. I was using the Solace model for walking/jogging to work, church, everything - but these, I could only get by with light walking around the office.<br /><br />You get what you pay for, again. They're good for what they are if you're just looking for a shoe to look decent and be easy to get in and out of in a work environment with some safety features. Staying on your foot snugly isn't one such feature, though.
A little tight across the top of the foot, but I think they'll stretch out with the number of times worn.
Great shoe really great fit and very comfortable, love the memory foam inside.
Am a Chef and this's the shoes have been looking for. Very comfortable, and the price... omg so soo resonable.
Kitchen, yard work, no slip. I've always loved Skechers!
Very comfortable
THE BEST WORK SHOES!!!., SUPER CONFORTABLE REAL LEATHER AND LOOK SHARP.<br />VERY HAPPY!!
one of the shoes the leather on each side  was split and damaged. which made me think this product was returned,then resell.
Exactly what I was hoping for.
I love these shoes they are for work. Fit well, comfortable, and looks nice. Speedy delivery too!
The shoes are great ! The soe for the shoes are extreamly comfortable and allow you to be on your feet for a very long time. I highly recomend them!!
Most comfortable shoes ever!!!!
Good Shoe
I was very pleased with this shoe here , I just did not expect brought joy. I like  fly , would recommend just such shoes scechers thanks for this production.
love these shoes they are comfortable and light. i wish they were a lighter more breathable.
awesome
Best work boot / shoe I've ever had, I'm an electrician and these are great for being on your feet and walking alot in a day. I recommend these to anyone in the construction field
Awesome!!! I love them! Fits ever so slightly larger than expected. Buts it's a good thing. Super comfortable.
Great seller, great discount product arrived in time and comfortable after a 12 hr shift while recovering with toe amputation and fractures in foot
Great comfortable work shoes. Way lighter than any steel toe boots. They meet the requirements for toe protection at work and keep my feet more cool and comfortable all day.
The first time I put these on, they felt fine.  After 30 minutes of walking around however, my feet began to ache.  I love the fact that they are so heavy duty, but I can't wear them for more than a half hour before my feet become too uncomfortable. I don't think this is a design problem, just my feet can't get use to the hard toe. If you can wear a hard toe shoe without that ache, these might be a good match for you.
My favorite shose for the job
I wear them everyday for work!  On my feet all day and my feet doesn't hurt!!
I ended up taking inserts from my other shoes and putting them in my work boots or I would have sent them back. I do wish you sold an array of inserts with memory foam.
I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  They are comfortable like a sneaker and protect as a safety shoe.
Love this shoes!
Order half size larger
Fit perfectly.
Its light and comfy..
comfortable shoes let's hope they hold up
Have two pairs......love them!!!  Concrete hangar floor 8-10 hours a day, no problem!!!!
Very Good and flexible also it's not hard or make smell when use it.
this is my second shoes the first one was the blue I relay like it but the problem with blue one is getting dirty easily that is way I order the black one because I can clean it easier than the blue. I'm using it in my daily work in Saudi Arabia and it is rely good for me I mean the price for my size and it is comfortably
shoes run in larger sizes for some reason, bought a size 10, probably should have ordered a 9.
Fits great! I work 7 12s and love these shoes!
So far so good.  Feel comfortable and very light weight considering the alloy toe.  Seems like a fine pair of shoes.
Great work shoes. Light weigh and very comfortable. My second pair. Will buy again.
good delivery and comfortable for the product
Probably the best work shoes I've ever owned. Composite toe protector, super grippy soles, (I'm on roofs often, doing solar work) and stylish enough to double as play shoes if I so desire!
in the zise chart i chose number 10 Us as i wear 44.5 EUR but wehrn i saw at the schoose size chart it is 10 US and 43 EUR, found too small to my foot. i notice that late
The best safety toe shoes I have owned.
Nice shoes, might be a half size big, but they fit pretty well. so far so good. Only had them a week and a half
Good fit
The color look really nice
i like it a lot only issue shoe had alloy toe i worked in restaurant all day its gone be heavy on my feet i returned but excellent non slip resistant shoes
Very nice and comfortable shoes.
I love these shoes, I'm recovering from two severely broken legs with frozen ankles. Upon going back to work where steel toes was mandatory my normal work boots was killing my feet and ankles. But these made a world of difference. So glad I chose the sketcher.
2 weeks wearing the shoes everyday and so far they are great. Lite weight and comfortable hope to wear all summer until it gets cold enough to start wearing boots again.
I like these BUT, after 3 months of use they already were showing signs of wear.  After 6 months the front sole is pealing back and the toes are wearing out.  These are only used in carpeted areas and not impressed with how short a time it takes for them to look like they are falling apart.
Have bought them before I  satisfied with the purchase
Half size too big
EVERYONE ASKS ABOUT THESE!!!!
After a week of 12hr days driving and lifting of heavy items, they are very comfortable. I work for a busy wood products/ lumber yard. I beat up boots bad. I doubt/ know they will not stand up to my Redwings boots. But they are soo light weight and I hardly wear anything bit boots. So I'm having fun wearing these safety sneakers until I destroy them. Hopefully they last the summer.
These are very comfortable for a safety shoe; you do need to order at least a 1/2 size smaller, I usually wear a size 10 1/2 so I heeded the other reviewers and ordered a 10, they feel roomy but  not so much that my feet slide around in them; overall I am completely satisfied.
Love them, lightweight and comfortable, not to mention they look pretty good for a work shoe.  I'll get back with a review on durability.
GREAT VALUE GREAT SHOES
Excellent
I work as a delivery driver for a major package delivery company. I am running around all day and needed a comfortable pair of non slip shoes. I wanted something with a protective toe because I tend to drop boxes on my feet (not on purpose...most of the time). These Sketchers fit my needs pretty well. They essentially feel like a pair of mid level running shoes, not too light but not heavy. I often forget they have they have a alloy toe because it's nowhere near as heavy as it's steel equivalent. They have descent arch support but could be better for me, as I have high arches. All in all I would definitely recommend these shoes and would buy them again.
Great shoes, sturdy, perfect fit, I'm very pleased with the shoes.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is connected to my order, but I received a call from a person named Phillip from Amazon Associates who asked me if I'm familiar with Amazon.com products. He then said he got my information from a company and wanted to talk about Amazon Associates. I asked him what company he got my info from and he refused to say which one. I said, &#34;Then I can't talk to you if you won't  tell me how you got my information.&#34;  He simply said, &#34;ok then, we'll try again tomorrow.&#34;  And hung up on me. I tried to call the number back but it was a digital recording.  I wanted to tell him that hanging up on me was not very polite and if you're calling me up, saying you have my private, protected information, at least have the decency to not hang up on me. I am very unhappy with Amazon right now, not with their product, but their customer service and their rude telemarketers.
Very well made and comfortable.  My husband wears them every day to work.  They are the only work shoes that do not hurt his feet.  they are also very durable and last a long time. Highly recomend!
So far so good.. will have to see over time. Totally happy so far.
Returned item due to metal  plate across toes for work. Needed for daily activities.
good shoe, delivered on time very light weight for being an alloy toe. 2 sets of laces come with it. feel pretty good. may want to go half a size bigger if you like some wiggle room for your toes but good shoes for work, cushiony soles.....
Great lightweight shoes for workplaces requiring safety toes.  These are easily slipped on and off, even when tied.  I have a pair of Timberland safety toe shoes that have much better insoles, but these seem to do the job so far.  My only complaint is that the soles are VERY slippery when outside on a snowy surface and also while you come in from the cold until the soles warm up.
Nice fit and comfortable
I work in the Oilfield and I typically walk 10-15,000 steps a day and climb 75 floors, while working a 12 hr day, two weeks at a time. So I am always looking for a lightweight, comfortable, and durable shoe. These shoes are almost perfect, but does have a few issues I will list.<br />Pros:<br />-The lightest, most balanced alloy toe work shoe I have found to date. Seriously light, feels like I am wearing regular shoes and notice how light the alloy toe is.<br />-Super comfortable, I have been wearing them for a couple months now and I walk on diamond plate steel surface and grating all day and these shoes don't hurt my feet at all or my joints.<br />-Great laces, these laces stay tied for really long periods and don't require constant re-tieing which is a huge plus for me.<br />Cons:<br />-Super slick sole on snow and ice. After being outside in the cold, and then coming inside onto a metal painted floor, I have to tread lightly, otherwise I will slip around.<br />-Durability seems to be not as good as other work shoes out there. I mean, they do hold up decent, but I am already seeing the black painted trim on the rubber/foam sole wearing off after only a couple months of use. Also the tip of the sole is peeled, but I was able to get it reattached with super glue. Overall though, it is still better than other brands I have tried such as Timberland or Converse.<br />- Flat sole with no heel. So I also climb a lot of ladders at work and it is a really nice feature on a shoe or boot to have a heel so when you climb on the rung of the ladder, it will &#34;hook&#34; and not slip. These shoes are completely flat on the bottom which doesn't give you that &#34;hook&#34; ability so you again have to tread lightly.<br />-No breath-ability. These shoes don't have any mesh or gore-tex material to allow your foot to breathe. But honestly it seems that my foot gets just as hot in these as other mesh type shoes, so I don't know how much this matters.<br />Overall, these shoes aresuper light and comfortable with the sacrifice of durability and slick sole. I really do like them for my type of work where the first two are more important than the last. Plus they are inexpensive and colors are kinda cool!
Nice shoes for a good price
I have a few pair of schechers so I knew what size to order ahead of time. They could use a little more cushion in the heel area but a insert fixed that and now they are good and much better than wearing work boots.
Look great fit is a bit snug an not as comfortable as expected overall an ok work shoe
awesome
Very light shoes!  Feels more like wearing tennis shoes than work shoes.
Good and high quality product
These shoes are fantastic! Lightweight and comfortable, and meets the safety requirement for my job. No more tired feet!!!
Very comfortable only had them a week so can say how long they will last. I'll be sure to review again in a about 6 months
I really like these shoes! Thanks for making tennis shoes with the alloy toe! What a fantastic concept! Please make more comfortable for standing/walking all day
Very comfortable, stylish, and light. A great summer work &#34;boot&#34;.
Were a little snug at first. Broke them in for 2 days and now they fit decent. Love how light they are, and the style. Just wish I got half a size bigger.
good shoes
I had to get shoes for work and this was the cheapest that didnt look like complete garbage. They're taking forever to break in. If I didnt have to stand in them brand new for 8 hours at a time I might like these a little more, but I can't argue with the price compared to any other slip resistant shoe
these just didn't fit.  the overall size was fine, but the composite toe was too tight and rubbed against the top of my big toe.  i went up a size but the toe box was still too small.<br /><br />i think the attempt to make these look like running shoes as opposed to safety toe boots compromised the size of the safety toe.
I bought these for my husbands new job & he loves them. He said they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned for work.
Great fit light weight
After trying to find a cheap, comfortable pair of work shoes with some type of safety toe that didn't kill my feet at the end of the day, I've finally done it.  I didn't even need to buy another insole.  I can't comment on how durable they are because I just got them.  But the slip resistance is great and most importantly, I literally was excited on how my feet and legs felt after 10 hours on a concrete floor.  It's like wearing sneakers.  Seriously.
these are perfect for work
Great shoes, very comfortable and fitted as expected.
A really good shoe for work, very soft and comfortable. I love them!
They fit perfectly.  Good traction and comfortable fit. Work on steep roofs and they are great.
Their size chart shows 9 US = 43 europe<br />But when i got it  9 US = 42 europe
I'm used to wearing steel toe shoes.......these are so much lighter....excellent investment
where the steel toe ends it rubs ever now an again
Perfect work sneaker
Really comfortable, especially on my feet all day
Great shoe
Nice purchase
Pretty happy with these. For work I've had to wear steel toes (or equivalent in this case) shoes for around 10+ years and these are easily my favorite ones ever. These are actually the first pair that felt good from day 1, usually the shoes I would get would be extremely stiff and uncomfortable for the first day or week.<br /><br />They look good, are pretty light for a work shoe, and at this point I've been wearing for around a year now and they are still in good shape
I gave these shoes a rating of 3 stars. I like the shoes, but hate the soles. I work in a machine shop and there are always steel chips on the floor. The non-slip soles on these shoes pick up everything. If I want to wear these home, I have to set for 10 minutes and pick the steel chips out before I leave work. I wish they made these with a different sole.
Very comfortable, love the color shipped in a timely manner!!!
Bought these shoes primarily because I liked the way they look.  Designed for warehouse work they are very cushy comfortable.  I've already referred two other people who wanted the same shoe.  I like the hard toe for protection and retaining shape when packed.  Once on not appreciably heavier than most similar shoes.  I'm a big guy and a backpacker and fussy about the fit of shoes.  These are very good.
They are just perfect. As black as possible with bright green laces and sole. Already ordered a backup pair can't beat the price.
Just saw the truth couple months of daily wear they literally fell to pieces for the inflated price i would not buy them get dickies venue 2 twice the endurance half the cost! I loved the look i did but they are junk:(
good shoes but laces are a bit short.
Within a couple months, the loops that hold the shoelaces in the left shoe have almost all been broken. Mind you, unlike most people of nowadays, I actually tie my shoes, and don't just slip them on and off. I need these to stay on my feet while I work. A pair of shoes from Walmart last longer than these do. Really sad.
My feet has been hurting and the shoes get worse and worse over time. For some reason the right shoe hurts my foot and seems tight despite it's the shoe size I normally wear. I have pain that lasts and for the price I paid it shouldn't be this way.
Really like it. Will buy more
my husband needed a new pair of work shoes that was comfortable on his feet and has non slip grip. since he works in a restaurant all day he needed something that would keep his feet from hurting and this was the pair for him he loved them and they worked great for him.
Like a lot feel secured in sleepery places n comfortable n breeth ok so far.
I love this shoes they just feel right,  I wear them for around 8 hour per day.
The shoes are great so far, hopefully they will last a while!
These shoes are real comfortable except for the arch support which does not come up to the old Shape ups
Went from red wing boots to these.  on my feet 9 hours a day in a auto repair shop.  lighter and more comfortable than big clunky work boots, and still have lether to protect my feet from welding and torching.  i have used them for 3 weeks, so far they are holding up.  even if they only last 1 year they are half the cost of the boots i was buying
I bought these for work in a kitchen that requires being on my feet for hours at a time. These, although not terribly stylish, look way better than the typical all black non-slip work shoes.They are very comfortable. As a matter of fact, they are not only comfortable work shoes, they are comfortable sneakers.<br /><br />Added bonus, if you spill something on them, they are borderline waterproof and wipe clean very very easily.
Good shoes, but after hours on your feet, they're not the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.
After switching from my other Sketchers to a different brand, I had to go back. I was going to get the same model as my last shoe but then I saw these. These are a little more stylish than my others but still had the excellent performance. These are great for restaurant work. Combine these with some of the padded insoles, and you can stand on your feet all day. They hold up very well and the non-slip bottoms are perform admirably. Great, great work shoe.
Thank you.
These shoes work great. I'm on my feet 6 hours+ a day at a restaurant and I have no complaints about them so far. I've been using them for about a month now.
Love this shoe but they're not very durable. Of course most non-slips aren't. Kinda weird right? I think it's the rubber matts behind the bar that is destroying them so fast. Btw the laces suck, get new ones.
Good shoes
I am an LVN at a skilled nursing facility and these shoes work well, they get exposed to all sorts of unmentionable fluids during every shift and they keep my feet comfortably protected.
Left shoe squeaks When I walk only had them 2 months brother has same shoes his are fine  muscle  must have got to Defected Pair
Great shoes and I mean great...... for about 2 months use. Then started hurting tight foot in the arch. Switched shoes pain went away. Again great shoe but if 2 months wears them out 60hours a day on your feet I'd chose something better
Im a auto technician and always on my feet. I felt instant relief when i put these shoes on. Also don't slip on oil or antifreeze. Nice shoes.
Light weight, great fit. Very good price This is the second pair that I use for work Every one loves the colors
These are one of the most comfortable slip-resistant shoes I have owned. I have been using slip-resistant shoes for 4 years and comfort is hard to come by. They grip reasonably well. I am very happy with this model of Skechers and will buy another when it is time to retire the pair I now own.
I would give 5 star but  only problem is water resistant. Didn't read the discretion.
Very comfortable.
I'm a ups driver so I go through shoes like tissues during cols season..after a month these shoes have held up to almost everything ..don't waste your money on cheap work shoes and you don't have to drop over a hundred either.
Great shoes!!!
I usually try to avoid any negative feedbacks on products, but this one I could not ignore. I work part time at two fast food chains and non slip shoes are required. However prior to purchasing this product I wore regular shoes and did not have a problem. When I started wearing these to work I actually fell twice while one the job, luckily I did not get hurt. I am writing this review so the shoe can be improved and actually do what it was meant to do. On a side note the packaging was really horrible and the shoe box arrived in bad condition.
I love my shoes. I use them for work..
When I order size 11 I expect it to fit and not hurt my big toe every time i wear them. its a comfortable shoe. just too narrow. and i have narrow feet.
Bought these for my husband because we have a cleaning business where he cleans carpets and tile. He would always slip coming in and out of His truck mount but not with these shoes. He loves them & requested I buy him a few more pairs. They are really comfortable, light weight and he doesn't slip on wet tile floors or coming in & out of His trailer ramp.
i have two pair of this same shoe, yellow and blue! love them.
Good
Wasn't impressed when I first put these on, but after a few hours of wearing them, they became much more comfortable. And I love the color/design of the shoes. I can't really expect any more for what I've paid ($34.35).
Fail to prevent slip
I ordered half size up and they were then the right size. The quality is good but not great.
Love them!  Super comfy and I can walk everywhere and not hurt really quickly
Like the shows, however they're a size to small. My Nikes are 12s I'm gonna need a13 in these
Look & feel great
Exactly what I ordered. Fits perfect and they are very comfortable.
This is an excellent shoe for those on feet all day ~ We had to use the exchange  on the original pair without any hassles what so ever ~ Shane with Customer Service was Awesome and she did it all as a Professional and in a timely manner . The 2nd pair { 1st pair came on a Friday } was delivered overnight . It was perfect . The first pair had on the left shoe an area of extra stitching that  irritated the side of foot . We are so pleased with these { Hubby really likes for work , as he is on his feet 8-10 hours every day }  Would buy these again  , love the grey and orange combo . Well worth giving these a try . I have in the past bought from Gravity Defyer { for twice this price } with coils meant to work with your instep, etc.  they were a good shoe but some of the claims in my opinion are just hype . We got a defected pair and sent them back for an exchange { after 2 months } of not getting them I called , was told there was a error in communications. They'd send them out asap which still took almost a week . I'll pass and buy here.
good shoes, very comfy, and great traction. However the provide almost zero arch support, my arches aren't bad and for me they'll be fine, but if you have bad arches or are somewhere in between I wouldn't recommend them, at least not without third party arch support put in them.
These shoes feel so good I bought I second pair. Have trouble fining shoes that work for me so I got a backup!!!!
So comfortable
Didn't have to break it in.
Great fit and comfort compared to most slip-resistant shoes! And it's great watching the bosses and safety guys come up to me thinking they've &#34;got me&#34; and then I show them the sole!! Haha
Too small and narrow, need to go up several sizes!!
I love it!!! very comfortable..
thanks rodney
this is not safety shoes
To small
non slip works im a mechanic
They feel really good on my feet. I haven't tried them on wet surfaces, but the grip is good on laminate and wood flooring.
I work in a restaurant that requires non slip sshoes& these are by far the best shoes I've come across. They look great& are super comfortable. I bought  a second pair bc they work so well
Great shoe.  Super comfortable right out-of-the-box and it seems as though they will hold up. Working in a kitchen environment, fryers, lots of grease on the floors, slipping is not a problem.
Way too big not their fair shoe was nice just wrong size and return was quick and helpful.
Had to exchange the 8.5 for 9.0. These shoes are light but sturdy, and they grip the wet linoleum at work. Solid looks, foot support, and traction make this a great bargain at the price. If they last, I'll be sure to buy another pair.
Super comfy!!
I work in the food service industry and am always looking for shoes that keep me from getting exhausted. Until now I had never found such a shoe. I bought these shoes hoping they would be comfortable and keep me going. I was surprised there was no &#34;breaking the shoes in&#34; time. They fit and were comfortable from the get-go. I run around a restaurant 5 to 7 hours a day and am highly impressed with these shoes. So when I took my son to the Mall of America for a day of fun I hoped the shoes would keep me going. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. and didn't leave until 5 p.m. From standing in long lines to get on rides at Nick Universe to checking out all the stores I never once thought about my feet hurting. This is truly the first pair of shoes I've ever purchased that I can honestly say I love.<br /><br />PS: I did take the recommendation of other reviewers and ordered a half size up and the shoes fit like a glove! Outstanding job on these! I will be back for more!!
I wear it and my friends love it, and I feel so comfortably
Great
Looks great. Feels even better. I Work 10 to 11 hours a day and it does help a lot with the slipping issues and it feels good ally day
Not nearly as comfortable as Skechers Sport. Could use softer heel,  better arch support, but pretty good.
Very comfortable and durable shoe/sneaker. I wear them all day while working which requires allot of walking and movement.
I have high arches and a wider size 13 foot and these fit great. i assumed i would need some dr sholls to make these bearable but i have no problem being on my feet for 7 hours as a 265lbs guy. they don't let in any water unless you get it in the tongue area but thats expected. been wearing them for about a month now and besides the grease and food chunks on them, they would look brand new! really impressed with these. worth the extra $15 over the uncomfortable walmart shoes that need $12 inserts and only last 6 months.
Comfortable work shoe and good on slippery tile flooring
Love them!!! Very Comfortable
I bought the orange pair for work in an environment where there is always flour and oil on the ground and it works good. Honestly there is no real way to have 100% slip proof shoes when in that environment but this shoe works good in maximizing surface area traction. The material seems to be relatively easy to clean by just wiping dry flour off or softly wiping with wet towel. Overall the shoe is good and does the job.
Good shoe for working and walking on a 7 acre job.
Light wait definitely slip resistant.
Very great product
Very comfortable, love them.
In the process of sending this pair back for a size 14. Nice looking pair of shoes, it was just too snug and I hadn't even put on a pair of sweat socks. I've never had corns or bunions and I'm not about to start now. Lol.
A very good work shoe for the restaurant business.
Technology that it would have on the sneaker didn't have on the boat they should implement that on the boat because that's  what we are looking for is a sporty sneaker type boots that are comfortable for all day working needs antifatigue technologyneeds to be composite toe three-quarter length scuff abrasion with the laces in the boots
Boots were to hard to break in by them being steel toe but made a nice gift for someone else.
Very Comfy I Ordered 14 I Wear 13 And They Fit Perfect LOVE THE boots. Add at least a 1/2 size for good fit.
Great work boots. Super comfortable to wear all day. The safety composite toe makes them perfect for industrial use. Slip resistant sole works great in wet conditions.
I ordered these men's work boots for my warehouse job which requires me to wear sturdy,  protective, slip-resistant, light weight, and r cushy shoes for walking around on solid cement floors for hours on end.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here and elsewhere, I decided on these babies.  BINGO!  The totally put an end to my aching foot (that I had surgery on two years ago) problem, just like ..... THAT!  And it's almost like not wearing shoes, they're that light weight.<br /><br />The support is perfect, and they are kinda springy to the step, the brown suede wipes clean easily, and they even look cute on me.  And as a tall female who wears a woman's 12M (men's 10N), that's important.  I can't find women's work boots in my size.<br /><br />****** The ONLY negative, is that they run about a half size too short.  But all Skechers brand shoes seem to.  I have other Skechers and had the same problem.  I totally forgot about sizing when I ordered, and naturally they were too short.<br /><br />I printed a exchange/return label on AMAZON, taped it to the box, mailed them, waited a few days, then VOILA, my 10M's were replaced by 10.5 M's.  The sellers was TOTALLY PROFESSIONAL, and even refunded me a few cents when the price changed between my original purchase and my exchange.  Oh, and I saved $42.00 by buying them here, rather than the Skechers site, or at ANY other major retailor!  Do your research.<br /><br />I'm VERY satisfied with my purchase, and I'm sure that you will too.
I have flat feet so the lack of arch support, which is expected in most boots, is quite comfortable for me.
Very Heavy boots. I returned them right after trying them on.
Great Boot.
Really great boot. Felt like I was walking on clouds for the first few days. Still feel great.
Love it!
Excellent boot very pleased with them do the job great .
Ok little over priced for what are
These boots are the most comfortable foot wear that I've ever worn.  I just hope the quality holds up.
Comfortable shoes,  highly recommend others to try them out.
I think the price is right in the very comfortable and light however adorable thank you
So far so good.
hurt my feet... not a lot of arch support
Bought this for my dad and he absolutely loved it! Although it looked heavy, it was very light-weight. This deserves a 5 start.
Style was great, and they seem well constructed. Overall they're comfortable, just a little tight across the toes, which came as a surprise since I have several other pairs of this product line in the same size that are perfect.  I've ordered a boot stretcher rather than give up on them.
I would recommend them, a little stiff at first, keep getting better with age.
Do the job well, come untied a lot
Haven't worn them yet but did try them on and the fit is perfect.
I liked my last pair of Skechers work boots, I'll see how these hold up.
Definitely one of the best pair of work boots I've boughten!
They are excellent. Very light but durable. They have very comfortable insoles. I have very low foot arches. So, usually I have to have inserts in all my boots and shoes. But, for once, I don't. The composite toe doesn't roast my feet in the sun like steel toes do. The steel turns boots into ovens for feet. The composite toe is just as strong in my opinion. Of course if anything heavy enough would crush my feet with composite toe boots on, steel toe wouldn't help either. It would just make ten times harder to get your boots off without ripping you toes off. In other words, this is a fantastic boot for the price. You get $200 worth of quality in around $70. I would give it more stars but five is all I can.
These boots are comfortable all day long and their not heavy like most others thank you sketchers!!!!
Love my sketchers.
Very satisfied with these boots.
Very comfortable.
I have worn may different type of work boots over the past twenty years and these are by far the most comfortable boots ever.
Great for the money
Needed work boots and these were just right. The composite toe rubbers it on the inside at first but they have broken in well.
After two months of wear the seam on the side has ripped. I would have expected it to last longer being a work shoe. Very disappointing since my husband loved the boots.
Love these
One of the greatest pair of work shoes I've ever had.
Very comfortable!
Second try with these boots... While Amazon was amazing and replaced the broken pair quickly the second pair aren't far from breaking again.
The plastic lace eye snapped/broke the second time I wore these.  I like skeechers, but these were a TERRIBLE investment.
Comfortable boot to wear daily.... however, one of the tabs for the shoelace has already broken. You need to be careful when tying the laces as not to pull to hard.
Look great. Heavy heavy heavy boots. Feel like lead blocks.
Nice
Awful wearing shoe to be on concrete with. Would not advise any one on there feet for longs hours to buy these shoes. Absolutely the worse pair of boots I have ever put on my feet...
GREAT WORK BOOTS !!
Boots are usually wider than tennis shoes. Comfortable shoe and waterproof for my needs in agriculture. Time will tell about durability
for thirty dollers you cant really go wrong here. they are extremely durable and didn't lose that new boot feel till a few weeks after wearing. i just put inserts in them since the boot shows no signs of falling apart any time soon
Great buy and fast shipping and I must say great quality.
good boot considering the price
husband loves these they don't crack and leak like a lot of mid rise weve bought,checking iragation wells and moving cattle. snow or rain great boot
My husband has wide flat feet and he went through several work boots. Ingot him these and he loved them. Asked me to order a second pair.
Great boots......perfect work choice for slip resistant environment. Worth every penny. Treat your feet don't go cheap.
Nice shoes.  Look broken in but new.  I have a wide foot, 10.5. Probably should have gotten 11's as I can only wear thinner socks with these boots. Maybe will stretch out as time goes on.
Very nice boots.  purchased for work, walking the concrete for 8 hrs plus daily.  Not sure how they will hold up.  Most of his boots only last 2 years at best before the heal comes apart.  We decided to give these a try and are hoping they will hold up.
I expected a whole lot more from a &#34;Skechers &#34; product .  A very poor attempt at a work boot .  I can feel every little thing I step on , sole is very thin.  The leather looks like a low grade .
I work for a railroad so I need good boots, I purchased these because of good reviews but I figured for $35 they wouldn't hold up, so far so good and I will give updates, I'm disappointed the price went up over $20 and I wouldn't have purchased them at that price.  So far good boot but a little wide
Let me first say that overall these boots are what I expected. I purchased them to serve a dual purpose of work boots / motorcycle riding boots and so far they are holding up quite well under those circumstances. My only complaint, and the reason I'm only giving three starts for now, is that they market the memory foam cushion very visibly on the top of the shoe, yet it hasn't helped nearly as much as I thought it would. I stand a lot at my job and i'm finding that after just a few hours on my feet my heals begin to fatigue and start hurting, despite the memory foam cushion. I've only had these boots for a week or so so I'll re-evaluate them once my feet have more time to adjust to them, and hopefully I'll be able to bump it up another star. I'm also holding out to see how they hold up over the next couple months.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fits as expected<br />Very roomy<br />Good arch support<br />Look fantastic!<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not as comfortable over time as expected<br /><br />Again, once the boots have more time to break in and my feet have more time to adjust then I'll re-evaluate my rating. Overall though, I would still recommend these boots over many of the other options, especially at this price.
VERY COMFORTABLE
was not happy with purchase, it is not as i had expected, the fit is not good, it is not a good support around my ancles and foot. not pleased and there is not much i can do to return.
Grest shoes they are very comfortable.
Great boots will buy again in the future. Very comfortable !
The boots were slightly large width-wise, which is okay since I wear two pairs of socks. Better slightly large than too small.
Purchased insoles for them & so far they're quite comfortable. Not a bad pair of boots for the price
They will turn the bottom of your socks red.
Good boots
Got these for my husband as an early Father's Day gift. He loves them. Durable, comfortable, and no slipping on the oil and fluids in the shop. Very satisfied.
A little skeptical at first,but skechers could be on to something nice boots at a nice price,would definitely recommend to purchase.Thxs
nice work boots the relaxed fit is ok, feels a little loose,the shoe size runs a little large,overall I am satisfied,just need to see in a year or so how they hold up
Best boot I've ever owned.  Would love to have another pair when these wear out.
good quality, good price
This shoes are very comfortable. This shoes is little big because I never find my size.
A1
Light weight, comfortable boots for someone on their feet all day.
Exactly what I was looking for, fit perfect, couldn't get a better pair of boots at this price.
very comfortable, sole broke very easy
Good boots very comfortable
Very comfortable, can't go wrong with sketchers
I like them more than what I thought<br />very comfortable smooth I really recommend
Very comfortable, I use them on the motorcycle, can't beat them for the price.
Not too bad for the price.
I received the boots and was impressed with the quality and comfort love these boots the fact they are shock resistant and cool to wear.
My husband has plantar fascittis and the boots are great for that.  He loves the memory foam insole.  He bought a pair a couple of months ago and wanted another.  He is an electrician and this are rated for his job.
Best price and deal
Larger than expected
It's a good shoes for daily work.
Got it on time. Really liked it so comfortabled.
The shoe was scraped when I received. But the shoe is comfortable and the return is not convenient. So I have to accept it.
Very nice boot, beyond my expectations! Comfortable fit, quality finish. We will see how they wear but I'm very pleased so far with this purchase.
First week of wearing them was ok.  They are comfortable in the heel but not much in the front so I placed air cushions inside. That made a difference.  I stand on a concrete shop floor all day so I need something cushioned anyway.  Size is exact for my foot.  The price is much lower than the past four pairs I have bought each lasting about 18 months so I am curious to see what kind of life these shoes will have.  They look nice but I am pretty hard on shoes so that will not last.  Hoping I will be pleased.
my husband wearing them daily says very comfortable right off the bat
Pleasantly surprised! It's a really American boot  just like film soldiers wearing, thick sole and leaher, great boot.
Relaxed fit, well I have flat feet and I have to wear two or three pairs of sweat socks to accommodate the width! I have to double tie the shoestrings because they won't stay tied. A pretty okay shoe overall.
Boots came brand New; i had these boots for more than a year and the are still holding up! I previously bought the same model at sketchers outlet, so i decided to give them another try.The inner lining however is showing tear and wear, and the sole that hits the floor with the back of my feet is worn out, but I am a heavy duty user. Comfortable I'd say is great, is just that with time  boots become loose and I have to tight more than when new. Overall they are quality boots comparable to Wolverine counterpart boots, but cheaper. HE and hard hat approved, I also had the steel toe version and both are still in good condition.
The fit is nice so far.  Nice sturdy feel and look. I'm a woman also. Haven't got the true feel just yet. Stay tuned... ok UPDATE: They're comfortable..
it's very comfortable and  not is heavy , I use all day in my work .
Awesome boots, great quality! I have a wide foot and was skeptical at first but since they have arrived, I have yet to remove them. Great fit. Only advice I could give would be to insert a full boot cushion.
Everyone's feet are different. That said. these boots chaffed my ankles and had way too much headroom in the toes. I tried inserts, but they couldn't bridge the gap to make the boots fit my feet better/more comfortably. The boots seemed well built. Just didn't fit my feet well.
Shoe is nice. However, they are wide at the sides and front. Shoes are too big and feets hurts
I took my old boots with me to work. In case I had to change out. There was no need, good right out of the box day 1.
Great product and perfect fit
Shoe is good. I have to use Dr. Scholl's insert to make my foot more snug and comfy in shoe,with out the insert shoe fits to large,especially in width. quality of shoe seems good.
Decent work shoes
Very comfortable shoes
I ordered the 1/2 sz up since I read the reviews first - the left shoe is a 1/2 sz to big and the right fits a tad to big, nothing a thick sock won't fix. I normally wear sketchers and should have just got my normal size. So my suggestion is just order your size. I am a womens sz 9 - I don't like my toes squished and these shoes are nice and wide as they are. Shoe looks nice, my co-workers liked them enough to look into them too .
Fit perfectly and they are very comfy
I bought these with high hopes, having loved a number of sketchers other memory foam shoes. There is nothing 'relaxed' or comfortable about these. I wore them before about 3 hours, mostly sitting and had to take them off. The heel area is hard as a rock and totally unforgiving. Nothing like sketchers other shoes. Returned.
They are comfortable.
The breaking in sucks like most shoes, but once you break them in they're not that bad. However they are a little big . Normally I'm a 9-91/2 but last time I bought 9 they were too small but after reading the reviews I again went with 9 n they're a lite big
Nice shoe just soo uncomfortable and tiring when wearing throughout day
I order mans size and I get the woman's size
I normally wear a 9, but I ordered a 9 and a 1/2 and they fit perfectly. They are very well made and I would definitely recommend them.<br />What I was originally concerned with before ordering was that they would be painful because I have very flat feet and any type of arch causes a lot of pain. But the memory foam is very nice. I wear these for about 9 hours a day (standing up the entire time) and I have not had any problems. With my old work shoes, I would start getting terrible back pains after a few hours. Thankfully, because of the soft memory foam insoles, I don't have that problem anymore. At the end of my shift, I feel so much better now.
Love the fit and comfort. They're like walking on air. No complaints. They fit as good as they look. A friend ordered a pair after first time seeing me in them.
good
I ordered a size ten. I have been wearing a size 10 shoe my entire adult life. These shoes arrived.  I opened the box. Checked to make sure they were a size 10. Label says size 10.<br />No way is the shoe a size ten. I could not get my foot more than 3/4 of the way in the shoe. I don't know if they are mislabeled or what but there was no way my foot was going in that shoe.
comfortable fit.  Arrived  on time.
I am 9 1/2  and I order that size, the shoes does not fit at all, the 9 1/2 looks like an 8. Does not fit, i will never buy again.
The size is not right
Great for work, always standing on concrete or brick flooring in a kitchen!
It is not comfortable at all. I got my heels hurt after 30 minutes' walk.
Shoes were exactly as expected and were delivered earlier than expected.  I was very pleased.
I wear a ten and after reading the reviews I decided to go with a half size smaller. Fits perfect! Good support! Worth every penny!
Just what my dad needed. He deff recommend them.
They are to narrow  and tight
Fits good but  a bit to large to the front .
Comfortable
My only complaint would be the a plus for most I suspect, it comes with an insul that is really thick and comfertable but I have collapsing arches and need specail insuls. I could not replace the insul as the matieral below it makes my insul slide.
Great shoes. I didn't know what to expect buying shoes online. But they were everything I was needing.
It is good, but I have to add a extra support to feel comfortably.
Everything is great! Fast shipping great quality!
This is my second pair.
I purchased this shoe because I liked the look of it.  However the second I put on the shoe it was so snug it was like a half size too small.  The shoe also makes squeaking noises even on carpet.  how that's possible I'm not even sure.  This is quite possibly the worst work shoe I have ever purchased, and was a total waste of money.
Nice item.
Shoes seem to be built for people with giant ankles and are larger than a usual size 10.
Very good
good for kitchen work
Thank amazon for my Min's Skechers Oswald it nice and good to my work. I love it. I love amazon. Amazon's is the fast.
I am a big fun of Skechers shoes. I always buys shoes from them for my work. I am working for food service and on my feet at least 8 hours a day. Nobody has bought these shoes before so I was little worrying about these shoes. I have been wearing them for a week and so far so good. First, toe area are bit tight but they are getting lose and fitting nicely. Memory forms inside shoes are very comfortable and good support for my flat feet.<br />Also, Skechers shoes always last long so money well spend.
I only give a three star rating because in the three months that I have had these shoes, the seam at the bend of the shoe has already torn. These shoes are very comfortable and needed no &#34;break-in&#34; time. I dont understand why there is not a double stitch on that part of the shoe since it is classified as a &#34;work&#34; shoe.
Super comfortable. Now my favorite shoes.
Shoes don't hold up to Food Service work very well. Already coming apart.
Good
Extremely comfortable shoes. Good quality. I have.<br /> Multiple serving jobs, work for all. And have almost no wear on them after months
Very comfortable and actually prefer them to my last pair of shoes except for the fact that they already have a hole torn in them ðŸ˜± and maybe better arch support, otherwise would rate 5 stars
The shoes fit great but they a little tight. If you have wider feet you might have a problem with this shoe.
good
Not near enough support for an old waitresses foot!
Very comfortable shoes.<br />My boss liked them!<br />I'm on my feet all day and these shoes are very lite so they're  perfect.
great shoes !!
I have no arches so still needed ortho.
Very good
Love these for work! I waitress for a living & have sciatic issues. Since I got these I can work my 8 hours & my legs & feet still feel great. Just wish I would of ordered another pair since it was such a great price in the 50% to 70% off sale but wanted to try them out first.
It is good working shoes in kitchen.
Fabulous!! Thank-you Rene'e
Love it!!
comfy shoes for work
they are comfortable, had to go up a size and they cracked after a month.
Good solid shoes. For the price.  A bit heavier than expected so might be better in cooler rather than warm weather and condition.  Nice looking for black shoes.  Need a little breaking in
she loves them.
It's good perfect fit for my feet
very good shoes I knew skechers would not let me down
LOVE THEM. They do there job on the slippery floors at the restaurant, look stylish with my shiny black slacks, and feel good on my feet ALL DAY. no break in time at all. You can adjust the laces in a few different places to make them fit differently. I have warn them everyday, all day long on my feet and my feet, back, and knees don't hurt.
This is a perfect fitting shoe.  Very lite and comfortable,  it's a narrow shoe so get a 1/2 size larger. I would recommend this shoe to work in 8 plus hours  I even bought me another pair for later
These shoes fit like a glove!  They are awesome!!!
They actually are very comfoertable and do work. I work in a nursing home and on wet floors all day haven't skid once. The only thing is once I got them they were a little tight but once I started wearing them they were fine and I had to adjust the insoles.
So comfortable! Perfect fit. I absolutely love these work shoes.
Fits true to size. A great and comfortable work shoe
Incredible deal,  great shoe. .. would definitely buy again.
I like fits perfect
Great shoes.
i love the shoes thier good for working in fast food...thier confortable
Best work shoe I've ever used.
These are the best work shoes ever! BUT for one flaw..they start to come apart at the seams in the toe after about 5 months, otherwise I could wear them for another 6. I keep on buying them for the comfort but I think the material needs to be much better, they seem a bit flimsy. otherwise a very comfortable shoe.
They're really narrow and hurt my feet.
Worked perfectly for nursing clinical
Too Stiff
Fit & feel great
Absolutely love these shoes and they are so comfortable. Had them a month now and they are practically ruined. One ripped at the top.
I love my Skechers thanks.
I liked the shoes just a little small in size
Does not look like a brand new shoe.  Shoe is hard and uncomfortable.  Would not enjoy wearing all day for work.
They fit alright as my work shoes. I usually wear a wide shoe because I have flat feet and achilles tendinitis from previous sports injuries, but since it wasn't available in my size, I went with my usual size not in wide.
More black work shoes for work.  I didn't get the right size so these were a little wide for me but I did get a good deal through the Warehouse.  The edges started to fade a lot and that is a problem I often have with black shoes.<br /><br />They have lasted me a good while for how hard I am on them.  If they had been the right size they'd definitely be a 4 star rating for me.
They were great
The third pair I had to return.. Too small
So comfortable I forget I have them on :)
Fell apart after 9 months. Leather was peeling. However they were comfortable.
bien
Bought them for my daughter for work. They are exactly as pictured and described.
Love these. Three months of wear still going strong. Only took a couple days to wear them in.
The shoes fit great and feel good on my feet but they squeeke when I walk. Very annoying at work.
Comfortable work shoes.
Very uncomfortable in the heel, rubbed all day.
Does it's job. Fits as expected. Brought these for another person and they love it. The soles give you pretty good grip to wet floors.
loves these work shoes... so much better than shoes for crews...
This shoes are so comfortable i can wear them all day without any problem
beautiful
My wife wears these on her feet and likes them
I have purchashed several work shoes that were very uncomfortable, but with these I finally got it right, when they say slip resistance that is what they mean. so glad I purchased such a great shoe. I highly recommend.
Good work shoes however they squeak  a lot & fit a little tight
I bought these for work as a CNA, comfort wise and function they are great... they are kinda ugly though. They look really good in the picture but when you get them they look funky... I can't explain it really i just don't care for the look of them. Also i am a die hard skechers D' lives wearer so it is not the brand just this shoe.
Great shoes, but squeak like crazy on any floor that isn't carpeted. Drives me crazy!
They completely fell apart after 3 months.  I know that am very hard on my shoes but I was very disappointed by this. This is not the first time this has happened with my work skechers. But up until they shredded they were extremely comfortable. This seems to be happening more with them, I don't know if it is the type I am buying or if they changed something with how they make them. I might have to switch to a different brand.
very much satisfied
I wear sketchers all the time and have another 3 pair, these were very narrow thru the ball of the foot, could barely get them on, sent them back , but the company did not pay shipping so I paid $13 + to send them back. All together a negative experience. Will not deal with Unique Soles again.
Too small. Had to return.
They're nothing special.. Not very comfortable.. I ended up putting a GEL insole in and it helped a little but not much for standing an 8hr shift..I wouldn't buy these again
Comfortable
Love my. Skechers
Shoes were described as extra wide and comfortable for work. They were neither.  Good price but poor fit.  I walk all day at work and need wide, cushioned shoes.  These will be returned.
These are very bulky and uncomfortable if you are waitress. They mark up easy and are cheap looking.
Speedy deliver was the best part for my pregnant, tired feet.
Excellent work shoes.  On feet all day.  Very comfortable.
I bought these because of the reviews. However r they feel apart after 8 months (about 5 days a week no more than 5 hours each day).<br />They are slip proof, but I am disappointed with how fast they feel apart.
Good quality, the size corresponds to the indication. Comfortably seated on the leg.
Good shoes for work.  I dont recall ordering a wide, but I was in a hurry to have them so I kept them.
I had the worst experience with these shoes. I tried so hard to trust that they just needed to be broken in but after 2 months of wearing them 6 days a week I can honestly say they are terrible. I got callusus because of them as well as problems with shifting in my toes. I tried a toe spacer, 2 different inserts, and still they fit horribly. Oh and might I mention that I got them after one of my managers at work got a pair. She got them a week before me and already has stitches coming undone and has also had to put inserts in because they were so uncomfortable and caused calluses. I wish I  could get my money back to get better shoes.
I wasn't happy with this purchase  they were very uncomfortable.  In the website they had free returns but of course in the fine print it said certain sizes.  Surprise!  Mine wasn't one of them. So if you think you can return them free....don't bother
Worst shoes ever, wore them one time and they caused huge blisters on the backs of both my feet. I ordered these in a ex wide but they were more like an ex small. Worn once and tossed them, do not waste your money
Great price great shoe perfect fit I orded the last one hopefully they get more instock
Nice shoes, toe ripped on second day, I would have been more frustrated if they weren't on a clearance price. Bought shoe glue and hope it holds for a while longer. I'd never pay $40+ for these. For the price, it wasn't worth shipping to send back.
I used to buy the walmart ones that look like converse, but they were used up very easily. These are more durable and comfortable they have more support. So happy I got these.
Nice support shoe for a great price.
From the reviews I thought it would be a more comfortable shoe. For me just okay.
I really love sketchers in general but these were not good for me as i stand for more than 5 hours. There is a support piece on the back that bothered and rubbed my heel. All of my other sneakers are 7.5 so I opted for wide with these and they feel like a full size too small. They do fit my teenage daughter who is a size smaller so it wasnt a complete loss and when I purchaed them they were on sale..
Most comfortable tennis shoe I have ever owned. Thank you for such a wonderful fit.
After reading all of the reviews on these shoes I was convinced they would be the most comfortabe shoe ever. They are roomy at the toe which I really like.There is no arch support. I wore these for an 8 hour shift and my feet were killing me. I am going to add an insert and hope that helps.
Very good brand in work shoes. Delivered in 2 days. Great
lovely shoes, but it's too small.
The shoes were pretty tight for the size, and hurt feet after wearing for a few hours at work.
Fits as expected<br /><br />It is so comfortable to wear<br /><br />Mother felt soles a little hard
It is very good!
I bought these shoes for my daughter. She has worn Sketchers shoes in the past but not this particular model. She was extremely disappointed that the shoes did not fit properly. Rather than return the shoes (which we purchased from Amazon at a very discounted price) she gave the shoes to a former coworker who regularly wears this style. The shoes were too small for that person as well. That's the risk of purchasing footwear online rather than in a store where you can try on the various styles, etc.
I bought it for my daughter as 14 years old student.Before I put the order I forgot to make one more larger size as a normal shoes size.Sorry for that.
great
I'm 8 months pregnant and was in need of some new work shoes.  These sounded good and were a good price, so I bought them. Two weeks later, they finally arrived (I've never had Amazon take that long) and I tried them on.  They seemed to fit well, just a little snug.  Today was the first time I wore them all day at work and my feet are killing me.  They definitely need broken in.  I'm just not sure if I'll be able to bare with the breaking in stage though.
I bye these to my mother and sister, they said:it's very comfortable,good !
Nice fit... Well do the job!!!
I didn't even wear these sneakers two months and the whole top side ripped.  i have never had a pair of work sneakers not last at least four months.  For most of February and March I actually wore boots over them, so they weren't even worn that much in the two months that I have had them.
Very comfortable.  I work on my feet for 8 plus hours and these shoes are good work shoes.
See my other rating for shoes from this same manufacturer ...<br /><br />These definitely run a full size smaller than labelled, and a full size narrower.  I had to remove the cushioned sole from the left one in order for it to work with my leg brace, something I've never had to do before.  I've been wearing size 9.5 M (US) women's athletic shoes for a couple of decades, so this appears to be a size labeling issue.  If you wear my size, I recommend strongly 10.5 wide width, to accommodate cushioned socks, if you plan on being on your feet all day.<br /><br />You may also have to remove the cushioned soles inside.  Just out of curiosity, I tried the one I removed in another shoe I've worn for three years without issue, and had a similar problem getting just the brace into the shoe, while getting both the brace and my foot (individually and/or together) was impossible.  The shoe still fits tight without it, limiting wearing time to just a couple of hours (even when I can't walk on the foot, and am using my wheelchair, no brace).  If you do not go with a larger size, you will injure your feet.<br /><br />As with the other pair, I have no issues with the overall quality beyond sizing, which appears to be inconsistent between one type of athletic shoe and another.  Read all reviews of this manufacturer's brand, and remember that each model fits differently from the others.  Other than that, they appear to be well constructed and durable, and a perfect choice for those who spend all day on their feet (if the size is right).
I expected them to be wider, since they were stated as extra wide
Comfy for work.
Not sure why these fit smaller than normal. Shoe is fine just to small
Purchased for my daughter who spends up to six hours standing for her job.  This is the 2nd pair we bought for her.  The heels rub a bit because of the shape of her foot, but overall she tells us that they are very comfortable.
the most uncomfortable shoes not like the other Sketchers I've had
Shoes gave good back support, but ran small order 1/2 size larger. I returned them.
Fit good and will last a long time. Good shoes.
Wonderful I like
somewhat a bit small than usual....
Let me clarify the low score for providing good arch support...I have high arches, and I am heavy. I put these flat in a matter of minutes. They are slightly narrow, but then I have wide feet. However, they feel good even after 8 hours on my feet, and I'm a waitress, so that's saying something. I also like that they're all black so I can wear them as part of my uniform. The price was great and it's a brand name I can trust!
I've had Achilles surgery on both ankles and needed a shoe that would support my ankles when I do yard work.  I wanted a sturdy shoe that would keep my foot from rolling to the side when walking on uneven ground.  These shoes are well padded, comfortable and hold my foot in place.  I feel safer in them.
I like this shoes, they are comfy but a little hurt my ankles a little bit.
firm fit when first used, you must loosen all the shoe laces completely and relace loose to fit your foot once I did this it felt very snug not tight,<br />great support makes me walk straighter and not lean to one side. great price excellent value, will see if they last as long as my other pairs (2-3 years) with all day use :)
They fit very well. I will definitely reorder when I need a new pair. Hopefully these will last for a while. Great work shoe.
Fits great.
Very comfortable. I work two jobs. Before when i came home my feet would be KILLING me. Now i barely notice.
1. The back of the shoe really hurts the back of my feet when walking. It felt a little better when I flipped the back tongue/flap down into the shoe. 2. The sole of the shoe is inflexible and hard, like walking on a brick. 3. The shoes are heavy; a problem if you have thin, light feet or walk light on your feet. 4. The soles are quite thick, which makes it difficult to feel the ground beneath you, especially when walking down a flight of stairs. 5. The side of the shoes rubbed against my pinky toes, which was really painful.  The only pros are the shoes fit and provided somewhat good arch support.
Get a half size bigger! Very comfortable!
It's a solid shoe. It's a bit narrow for me but I have wide feet so no reflection on the shoes besides like all shoes it just needs to be broken in.
Fit well, arrived quickly, and great price!
Love these shoes.  Will be buying another pair in black for work.
It is a gift to my wife. The price is wonderful. The shoes seems good.
Comfortable
My daughter loves them.
Did not fit and they were ugly,  returned.
Terrible work shoe. Hard to break in. First day my ankles were killing as they were rubbing onto the sides. The front (tongue) was hard on top of my foot and felt uncomfortable. Wore them for a week and it gave me a blister on my right big toe even though I got the extra width. TERRIBLE. 2 weeks into still uncomfortable on the front top part and my toe still hurts!!! DON'T BUY!!! STIFF and HARD material!!!!
Without actually wearing these for work I can tell you I like the price. I had to return the size 9 for a 9.5 because they were very narrow and tight At the widest part of your foot. I returned the first pair easily.  After wearing them to work they are not very comfortable. I may just put some cushioned inserts in them. I still like the price and that they are non skid. After wearing these for several shifts lasting 4-11 hours I have to say I do not like these shoes; they are not comfortable and my feet are achy after wearing them. I do not recommend these; I am looking to find another comfortable, supportive pair of work shoes.
My wife likes them. There very comfortable
The sneakers were good quality just a little to small
It's too small so order a size up, I've got the extra wide and it's still pinches my toes!
excelente
Good, basic work shoe. Gave me blisters after awhile, but might be my socks!!
I will order another pair very soon. I love these, they fit perfectly. I have a lot of trouble with my feet and these are wonderful.
The shoes were shipped very fast! I havent worn them for work yet but they are heavy and do have the arch that i was looking for, cant wait to try them out tomorrow!
Light and comfortable.  Quick delivery
Finally found the right shoe for a nurse !!!
Comfortable shoe for 12 hour shifts on hard surface!
Comfortable but i order a bigger size
Go 1/2 a size up. Lots of comfy padding but it takes up foot space.
They are way too small and I have to pay six dollars to return them
Very comfortable!
Wonderful shoes, so comfortable
Overall very comfortable jus recommend going a 1/2size bigger than normal I work 12hr shifts so need comfortable shoes definately worth it;)
I work two jobs, and these wonderful shoes get me through a twelve hour day on my feet serving.  I have worn them for six years and don't buy anything else.
So I wrote that review a couple days after I purchased the shoes,  I would like to amend my review due to the fact that after wearing the shoes for 8 weeks, THE BOTTOMS FELL OFF!!  Yup, it turns out that the non-slip bottoms are held on only but two little dabs of glue.  They started falling off up at the toe and then at the heel and after Shoe Glueing them in several spots, I finally gave up and let the whole bottom come off :(  There are two other ladies at work that have these exact same shoes except they bought theirs at a department store and their shoes are fine................ I'm now wondering if the people at skechers are supplying amazon with less than premium products so that they can keep within amazon's determined price points?  Very sad :(      Were a little snug right out of the box, so I just wore thin socks the first couple of days.  No 'breaking I'm period.  ! They never hurt my feet and I didn't have to break them in.  I work 10 hour shifts in them and they haven't gone flat. They have thick soles for absorption but I wish they had more arch support .  I would definitely buy them again....only $35!!  No knee pain either and they don't push your weight into your toes.  Just have to wait now and see how long they last.......................
I love the look and functionality of the shoe (non-slip). The size is good, but it is a narrow fit and is very uncomfortable. My small toes are red and swollen at the end of my shift. I work in a bakery and am on my feet all day. If I can't get these shoes to loosen up a bit, they will be replaced.
Bought a pair of these & they lasted 8 months.Finally got rid of them just because of the germs as I work as a nurses aiaide.Tried another type of shoes and they slipped to much.Gave In and bout another pair of these. So comfortable and love the slip resistance when walking!!
Love them
Good!
fast shipping. Just not a shoe for all day
Excellent quality with nice design and reasonable price.
Best work shoes yet!!!
Not for the long haul in the restaurant industry. I purchased these shoes last week hoping the poor reviews were untrue, unfortunately they are not. I work at an incredibly busy restaurant that has multiple floors both of wood and custome tile as a food runner. The soles on these shoes are so thin you can feel every grout line and crack in the wood. The soles are not the best in slip resistance  especially near the dish pit. The toe box is tight and the shoes slip off easily, there is only a flimsy 1&#34; strip of Velcro to close the shoe, so you can't really get a tight fit if you wanted one. I even tried my own inserts to increase the comfort with no luck. I hope I can return them cause for $70 I was hoping for a bit more comfort. 2 stars, cause I like the look, otherwise I would have rated this product a 1 star.
Fit comfortably over the past year that I've had them.  I'm on my feet at work for 5 or so hours at a time, but they've never become uncomfortable when worn longer.  They've really started to fall apart in the past few months, though.  Holes have formed around the area of the toes where my foot bends.  The velcro has also started wearing out.  The shoe fit true to size for me.
Loving it!
A little wide but I do have a narrow heel. Otherwise it's super comfy.
Good for work
Wish I had sent these back very uncomfortable
I love my skechers z strap, very comfortable
I stand all day at work, and the comfort level is not a good one. I was expecting more from Skechers. The shoe also looks plastic, but the label says leather.
Very comfortable I'mgoing to reorder another pair for my daughter
came apart at the soles
fit as expected
Perfect
Look adorable, very stiff.
Very comfortable shoes
returned and ordered somewhere else
Good quality
I bought these shoes when I began working in a local Japanese restaurant.  They are amazing!  They don't look very sleek, but they are sturdy and will hold up to just about anything.  I dropped a five-gallon bucket of soy sauce on my toe and didn't feel a thing.  I can walk on wet floors without having to exercise caution, because these shoes do NOT slip.  I even wore them outside in the winter, and I honestly could not tell the difference between walking on the ice that was coating everything and walking on dry ground.  The only time I did slip when wearing these was when a customer spilled shrimp sauce on the floor; but shrimp sauce has a high amount of oily mayonnaise in it, so it's natural to expect some additional slipperiness with it.  I also used these shoes for my nursing school clinicals for two semesters; and will continue to use them, both for my current job (ice cream shop) and for when I get back into nursing school.  I bought a pair for my daughter, who works with me, and she loves them as well.  They fit very well, although the toe seems a little bit too roomy.
Goog
This would be a great shoe if the MANUFACTURER HAD SIZED IT CORRECTLY!  Tried wearing thicker socks.  The shoe is bulky, cumbersome and caused my ankles and knees pain.  Why?  Because I was trying to keep the shoes on my feet!  This is not a true size 7 Medium width.
Also the toes of the shoes are off (nonmatching).
Very happy with these shoes
It provides great arch support.  I just wish it was a little softer the first day I wore it it was a little too stiff and my feet were sore.  I feel the socks I wore did not help
I love it
Safety toe is very uncomfortable.  Poor cushioning. Sole of the shoe is coming apart after only 1 month.  After a month of use I have given up on these.
I bought wide E, but it did not seem like &#34;wide&#34; I expected. Also length is longer comparing another shoes
Great,  comfortable shoes.
I have used these shoes for a high volume walking job for a long time.  They were great for walking high distances on hard grounds. Once I got pregnant they couldn't really withstand my extra weight.
Very comfortable and lightweight. Outside material seems to be holding up. Then after about 2 months in I almost ate it twice at my restaurant coming around corners. The non slip needs work!
very comfortable shoes, light weight feels good while im wearing them
I've purchased these work shoes before. They definitely need breaking in, but they provide the best support for me at work. the last round I purchased some memory foam versions of the skechers for work. Boy was that disappointing. I waited because it was an investment, but I couldn't wait to need new work shoes so I can go back to these babies.
Good product
love my skechers womens compulsions chant...
Very comfortable shoes
The shoes fit very well, and are super comfortable.  I love them
Excellent pair of shoes for work and comfort.
They fit as listed for me which is shocking - but I have narrow feet and long toes. So a size 9 fit me fine.<br /><br />They do NOT skid!! I'm a barista and I haven't died yet despite being faced with some very wet floors. This is good news for me. Also they are comfortable and I find my feet aren't cramping by day's end.  Do they breathe? No, not really. Be prepared for pungent feet. I get regular pedicures so it's not as bad but somebody that doesn't take care of their feet might need to keep Lotrimin on hand or something.<br /><br />I would never sacrifice safety for something that can be taken care of with good personal hygiene though. I rate these a 5 out of 5.
I am 36 year old female who has taken a &#34;part-time&#34; job at a fast food restaurant to pay off bills before little one comes.  I have plantar facitis and bunions.  I do wear an insert, but these shoes are amazing.  They are very slip resistant and help my feet with the unforgiving concrete and standing in one place for hours.  Very impressed!
For being work shoes the bottoms are slippery. I did not like the feel of the leather.
At tad expensive in comparison with other Sketcher's slip resistance shies but these are worth the difference. Very light and comfortable. I would  buy again.
The leather is cut on the shoe and rubs against my little toe causing discomfort.  I'm on my feet for a 15+ hr shift and 2 hours into my shift wore both shoes completely unlaced and my feet we're so sore. I've had great Sketchers work shoes in the past. This was a $40 ish lesson learned. The only plus is the skid proof soles. I can walk ome water.  Style is cute for a work shoe,  maybe  a good shoe if you don't need to be on your feet. HAHA
Where them out in five months.
Item was received on time and as described.
Purchased for my 17 year old for work.  She wears an 8M.  These were too narrow.  She likes the look and quality, just too narrow for her.  Sending them back for a credit and have purchased in their place the Skechers for Work Women's D'Lite SR Work .  My daughter loves the the new 8M D'Lites and they fit her great.
I usually love buying Skechers, unfortunately these are sized a half size small/too narrow and virtually no foot padding . I work upto 10 hour days in a Nursing Home and  my feet ached after half the day.  My employer requires non-slip soles and I have to have some kind of padding at the ball of the foot for comfort. Quess i'll have to buy something else.  Quite a disappointment.
My feet feel very good and comfortable will be buying these shoes again
I've never had a pair of uncomfortable sketchers...until these.  By the third day of barely making it out to my car after work, I have given  up.  Tried to put insoles in, but it made the shoe too tight.
Uncomfortable and smaller than expected. Not a lot of cushion.
Shoes aren't too bad although my feet still hurt. The shoelaces are horrible. I shouldn't have to replace good shoelaces but these always become untied. I spend more time tying them over and over than doing anything else.
Perfect
Hard shoe, not sure how long it would take to break in for longer wear...
I am a sever at a busy restaurant, am on my feet, running for up to 8hrs a day, carrying heavy trays...I am pleasantly surprised how light these shoes are with the support they provide.  I highly recommend these shoes.  Over the years I have purchased way too many shoes for my work, many different brands and styles...think I have finally found a keeper
I like the shoe but when I wore them to work they hurt my feet... I thought they be a good fit for my feet but no they where to tight and very uncomfortable to my feet.the next time I no to get a size bigger in sketches
They would be perfect if had more of arch for support. Took a few days to wearing to get use to them.
didn't hold up well at all
Good Fit
I LOVE it!
I ordered a 7W, which is what I wear in every other Skechers shoe I order, except sandals where I order a 7regular. This is much too narrow and the toe box is too tight as well. I've restrung the ties to give me as much room as possible over the top of my foot, but there is no fixing the too tight toes. I suppose an 8-8.5W may have fit, but I'd rather gripe about this one than take the time to send it back and gamble again - we live where the nearest UPS dropoff is 30 miles away.
Great durability, looks good. Not very cushioned for those who walk on concrete all day. Could use improvement with insoles.
Love these shoes for work in a restaurant. This is my third pair. Unfortunately they only last me about 6 months TOPS but they are worn on average 5 days per week. Very comfortable.
Comfy shoes but they do not work well. I slip all the time. Will not buy them for work again.
I'm so disappointed.  I returned the first pair due to a seam that was not intact, otherwise they were fine.  New pair has a hump on the sole that feels like it should fit between the ball of my foot and toes, but sits squarely under the  ball of my foot.  Not going for a third try since the first two were so inconsistent.
Yay! Finally, a stylish, comfortable, lightweight OSHA compliant work shoe! Fits true to size, easy to be on your feet running around a restaurant in these shoes. And they look cool, not like the clunky shoes I have been forced to wear because they are good for you. These are great and I must stress again, lightweight!
Love them.  Good price on Amazon
they fit very good and I save some money by not through Amazon
Exactly what I wanted at a great price, fast shipping and wonderful quality!
my wife wear this to work all day. very comfortable.
I ordered these shoes in a size E, because I have a wide foot.  These are narrower than my current normal width shoes.  Terrible.
Perfectos
This pair of Skechers work shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. I had another pair of Skechers work shoes with a Comp toe. They were causing me pain and I wanted to try a different shoe. I still needed slip resistant soles and a safe shoe so I thought this pair was reasonable in price. I have only worn them for a few shifts so far but I really like them. They are so light and comfortable.
Very stiff and uncomfortable.
Love them for everyday work and lots of walking! They are comfortable and I can wear them for over 12 hours without any issues.
These womens shoes are worn by a package delivery fortune 500 company employee comfortable worn up to 10-12 hours a day no cpmplaints
Very good nicely made shoe...  I stand on cement all day so was a little sore after a few hours in these new shoes.. Once I added extra gel insoles, I could wear them all day...
I GOT THEM FOR WORK, I AM ON A CONCRETE FLOOR WITH A MAT.  THE WORK PERFECTLY
These sneakers are very cute & would likely be good for most people, but I wouldn't recommend them for those who need lots of cushion in the sole. I found the sole to be thin & soft in the ball area of the foot & was painful walking. I tried adding gel inserts, but was no help. My feet have been through a lot of abuse so need much support & cushion. Really need to see them in person & try on first. Very cute sneakers though.
They were to small
Despite the size being tighter than I expected, they're surprisingly comfortable. The first day I got them I feared I would have to return them, but after wearing them for several hours they won me over. They have extra cushioning in the heel area. They appear to be sturdy and well made.
Made very cheap. The first pair I received had two different insoles so I felt off balance when I  walked. The replacement pair had too much material sewn around the tongue and rubbed blisters on my toes. Would not recommend.
I love, love, love these shoes. I have always been weariking skechers sneakers, BUT since now you can only get these 'memory foam insole' crap that hurts my feet and doesn't give me the needed arch support, I was so excited to find these shoes online her at amazon, and at this price.<br />they fit well, they feel great, give the needed support... I might buy a second one just in case...
I bought these because I needed an all black shoe to officiate indoor volleyball, and was unable to find any athletic shoes that were solid black, let alone comfortable for 12+ hour tournaments. I'm glad to toss the Asics that pinched my feet and didn't hold up. These were both inexpensive at $40, and comfortable. The only negative is that they do not offer a lot of ankle support.
Fabulous
These are my first pair of non-slip work shoes.  I am very happy with my purchase!  My feet did not hurt at all during my shift.  The size is as expected......I wear 8 1/2 and ordered 8 1/2.  They fit perfectly!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for shoes for work.  I am very happy with them and the price!
Comfortable shoes for a eight hour workday. I was skeptical about the comfort but they are pretty comfortable.
Great shoes for long hours on your feet at work! Super comfy and fits perfect.
Perfect fit. Put them on and worked an 8hr shift with no achy feet. Lightweight and very comfortable.
These are the most uncomfortable shoes ever. I'm standing for 6-8 hours and my feet and legs hurt so bad wearing them. I take them off as soon as I get into my car after work. DO NOT GET THESE SHOES. too bad I'm stuck with them.
Very comfortable for work shoes.
No comments is all good.
Too small I ordered the size I normally wear. Uncomfortable
they wear out extremely easy. I started my serving job in January and by the end of march the fabric by the ankles were worn out to holes
These are great & comfortable!  But how can you go wrong with Skechers!
Fits great,  I bought them for work because I needed an all black shoe. They're light weight and easy to walk in.  I normally wear a 7.5 and the 7.5 fit perfect.
Perfecf
Great walking shoes!
They are great for work
Comfortable.....
Wasnt sure how the shous would fit. I purchased the same shoes i already had. I used the info on the inside of the tongue and when purchasing online the shoe size chart was misleading
weird shoe- first pair i owned were a 10 and almost too small. maybe from shrinking? never washed them though, very strange.<br />bought a  pair that are a size 9 and they're too big...<br />quality has decreased but they are otherwise a great shoe that arent too nerdy.  very plain, black sports sneaker with no frills. they're great if you live somewhere like a city that gets slippery when it rains (not good in the snow, though). i wear these all over the place in the summer for days on end and my feet never hurt. will probably buy them again!
All Right!
Uncomfortable fit, but it looks stylish though!
They are not very comfortable...I tryed them at work but not working
Love these shoes,my legs were killing me at work ,standing for 8 hours now it's not so bad
I walk all day so these shoes were great.  No breaking in, first day I wore them and it was comfortable all day.
1*
These sneakers are great. I wore them for 2 and half years before they started coming apart. They are very comfortable and have good support.
Love these shoes
Great ..last long time! !
UTILES
Love these shoes<br />Use them for work and my feet do not hurt<br />I manage a kitchen in a school district
great work shoe... on concrete most of the day.
I have a bad ankle and recently had to have surgery. These shoes were recommended as being more comfortable because I have a very high arch. They provide good arch support and don't put too much pressure on other parts of my foot. Just wish they came in a 'high top' version because my ankle swells when I wear them all day.
I bought these and the Skechers Women's Go Walk Move - these shoes are not as soft under foot.They are comfortable but the Go Walk are far better for all day wear. I think they will take a bit of time to wear in. The toe area is also a bit narrow so I'm wearing thin socks - the leather is soft so I'm hoping they will stretch a bit
Great shoes
Bought one pair, and a couple of months later bought another (just in case it became unavailable, so I have a spare).  Wear them all day to work and they're all-day comfortable and supportive.  Love them!
These shoes are like walking on air  yet have supportive arches. I ordered them 1/2 size larger and added my orthotics on top of the insert.
These are a great work shoe. They aren't anything stylish or pretty but they give great support and comfort. They would have been rated a 5 star but they do seem a little tight on the foot, more narrow than your standard shoe. Also, because they are anti-slip they squeak like crazy on linoleum and tile if its not wet.
These shoes did run small for the size. They were too tight and did not give at all.
They're comfortable if you buy insoles ! But they're really nice and I'm at 7 or 6 1/2 ordered a 7 just in case but didn't trade it in because I didn't want to get one too small! Still satisfied  though!
Great work shoes!  A bit long, but still very comfortable.
These shoes are the best! I wear them all day for work as a personal care worker and student nurse. They have enough coverage to not get soaked while showering people. Super comfy and they don't look half as bad as some other nursing shoes I've seen.
I love this work shoes cute shoes
Excellent shoes for Massage therapy! I do up to 7 massages a day, and these are perfect!
I can only wear these a few hours before my feet hurt. They are definitely too narrow though.
ok
Nice slip resistance but if you're a waitress like me and on your feet all night they will end up hurting!! Went back to crocs and now my feet are happy again!
I wear these shoes to work on occasion - great support and comfort.
I bought this shoes at a skechers outlet. At first when i fit it, it was comfortable.  But after wearing it for two weeks everyday my feet hurts so much that I cant work propely. Specially im a server and we stand and walk all day on our shift. I will return it and id rather invest in a 100 shoes than using this and suffer everyday.
If the material soft little bit will be perfect
I should have ordered a full size larger than my regular shoe size. They are one half size too short. Fit good otherwise.
ok
thats great
The They are like slip on shoes and i loved that but theback of the shoe cause sores on my heals
The shoes were comfortable, fit well and seem to be of good quality.
Love everything l receive from amazon.
I had only ware for one day at work. So far.<br />for the first time in a long time that new pair work shoes it's not hurting my feet. Loving it !
I like them but I didn't know they were going to be a little bigger, I got an 8 1/2 because that's what I usual wear but I guess because they are slip on I should have went with a 8 . I can still where them with two pair socks though so it's kool .
Perfect
love my shoes fit  ok
Very comfy and fit perfectly;)
love it
I have been wearing these sketchers for several years and they are the BEST!!!  all around every day shoe LOVE
Great shoe and very comfortable. Light weight
Shoe is probably fine, but way too wide.
This is the second pair of Sketchers for work that I've bought that have lasted less than a year. First pair were lace up, and then these slip on. Both pairs of shoes started out being really comfy for my easily fatigued feet, and now they are starting to hurt my feet and the soles start separating from the upper part right around the toes. Since I am in need of a third pair of shoes in 1 1/2 years, I believe I will be getting something other than Sketchers.
The shoes are really nice and comfortable too. Thank you.
The shoes are exactly as they were described, fit perfectly, and came when expected
I've got to say these have got to be the most comfortable shoes I've purchased in a long time. I took them out of the box and wore them working a 10 hr shift as a restaurant manager. Absolutely no foot or back pain at the end of my day. Comfort, support and appearance definitely an A+.
I'm on my feet for 8+ hours a day. After 3 hours my feet hurt alot. Will not buy these again!!!
I really like these shoes. I work in a jail, and they hold up well to my daily duties. I have noticed that after a few months, the side where the rubber and the shoe itself meet are peeling apart. It's not bad, and does not hinder the shoe in any way. If it didn't do that, I would give it 5 stars.
great product
Not comfortable.  They slide up and down on the heel and the soles are hard as a rock with very little arch support.  I expected them to be comparable to the tennis shoes, but they are not.
I wear 9-91/2. I ordered 91/2 and they were too small. A coworker who wears 81/2 said they fit her perfect
Just what I needed!
I liked the shoe alot but they run a bit small. I had to return them and sadly a bigger size was not available. I like a wide width and these do run narrow so if you are on your feet alot go with a wide width and if they are to wide then use thicker socks. You will be glad you did.
Daughter is on her feet all day and she loves these shoes. They fit as expected and are easily cleaned, if needed.
These shoes were okay for the first 2 or 3 months I had them. I would occasionally slip but not fall. I think I must have worn the traction down because I did end up slipping and falling at work. Will be looking for another pair of shoes.
Never feel tired when I take it to work
Confortable
Fantastic!!!!
the skin on the back of my foot completely came off the first and last time I wore this shoe
I had one of the exact shoes for 2years and could not find it anywhere. I am so happy to have another pair which I wore the day after I had collected them. I love it.
These are great for work and slip resistant.
Good shoes, I just wear them out. Also, smaller than other sketchers Ive bought.
Sorry to say but will be sending these shoes back. The sole is very thin and no support at all. Was very disappointed in them. Will buy different style. Not a shoe for me, I have bad feet and there is no support in these shoes at all.
Fit as nice
Not a perfect fit, but very comfortable for my 12 hour shifts
Though I have always loved my other Skechers shoes, these shoes are incredibly uncomfortable. There is virtually no arch support, the heel is too wide, and the sole is thin. As a waitress, I need shoes that will last me through the night. This pair started to hurt my feet within a half hour, and by the end of one night my arches were cramping and my legs were aching as well. I will go back to my old Skechers until I can find a pair like them.
Too small & fits tight, feer were aching & they don't have a good arch support.
Fast shipping and great product.
Not only do these shoes support you they help you last all day on your feet. They have lasted me 3 service jobs in the past 2 years with 40 hour work weeks. They are just now getting holes on the side. I love these shoes. I'm happily ordering them again right now. :)
love these shoes!! they're really comfortable and fit perfectly. true to size. cute and stylish. shipping was fast too! the only thing is, they are low cut shoes, so you either have to wear extremely low cut no show socks, or your socks will show.  UPDATE! still love these shoes, but the &#34;laces&#34; on both sides broke. they were just dangling there, and since the shoes were slip ons and didn't technically need the laces, I just pulled them off instead of trying to figure out how to fix them. not as cute anymore, but still really comfy.
Wonderfully comfortable
love these shoes, very comfortable and true to size!
Awesome shoes!! I just wish that they were more resilient and waterproof.
Sooo dissapointed. The fit was a bit tight. I wear an 11 in women. And the fit round the ankle was extremely low. Too low for a work shoe in my opinion. But these are cute and do have a nice arch. Sigh.. back searching again.
Got these skechers for a friend.  She loves  them!!! Gr8 work shoe
The shoes fit wonderful however,  my feet were still sore during and after my shifts.  I also got blisters on my heels even with a perfect fit.  The shoes are comfortable but didn't meet expectations with advertising.
Wife loves these shoes for work.  This is the second pair we've purchases.
They weren't bad at first...but the longer I wore them the more I noticed that they're way too tight on my feet and it's caused more issues for my feet rather than making it easier to be on my feet 10+ hrs a day.  I figured I ordered a size too small (even though this is the size I always wear) so I ordered another pair next size up plus wide and it's still painful.  I like Skechers but definitely won't order these again.
These shoes are awful! Generally work shoes have a decent insole. These were nearly flat and rock hard. No cushion or support at all. I wouldn't wear these for 5 minutes, certainly not all day at work
They were prefect. Love them. Looks great with my uniform for work.
Am most happy with the Skechers.  Wear them when I mow the lawn.  Very comfortable.
my wife says these are the best work shoes that she has ever had...<br />we have purchased shoes for crews, and these have already wore these longer than any other work shoe she has gotten!!! Great product
Very comfortable and fashionable  work shoe.
I have been buying these Sketchers Work shoes since 2009.  They are high quality and stand up to a lot of abuse.  Once you wear them in, they are very comfortable.  They are most definitely slip resistant.  I have NEVER had a slip and fall accident with them.  This is the third pair I've bought over the years.  Definitely worth the money.
Nice work shoes, fit well.
I am a server and am on my feet for 8 hours a day. I've always bought Skechers because they last longer than others, but never the work line. These shoes are perfect! They fit perfect and have a great amount of support and are still the smaller, not too chunky/awkward of a style (I wear a skirt to work and these look good with it). Love them and I ordered on a Thursday night and they were at my door when I got home from work on Saturday....nice job Amazon on the super fast shipping and the amazing price,  I really needed these fast!
I own more than half a dozen different Skecher shoes and had high expectations for these work shoes. They did not disappoint. The sizing is consistent. Every pair I own is the same size and fit. The work shoes have a great non-skid sole, perfect for my new job. And they're comfortable enough to be on my feet for 6-7 hours at a time. Definitely recommend them.
Excellet!!! Â¡!!
the left shoe fits great.  The right show rubs on both the back of my heel and the top of my big toe.  For that reason, I only wear for about 4 hours at a time.  And, I am unable to wear regular socks as it makes them feel tight, so have to wear trouser socks.  I like the shoes, just wish the right one was as comfortable as the left.  I did get a 1/2 size larger than I normally would because of previous purchases and other reviews.
Shoes are very comfortable and fit true to size- good buy!
Love the shoes although for narrow feet!
I sent them back.  They slipped on my heel.
Not enough support for working shoes. if you work at a desk they will do, but if you are on your feet all day like I am..... they don't work
Good shoes. Look nice. Been holding up well for daily wear. Just not the greatest support. My feet hurt a little after standing around at work for a few hours. Knees as well. But overall, good shoes.
They run a little tighter than I hoped. Also not as comfortable as my shoes for crews pair but will try them with different insoles. Stylish  though.
I went by reviews and thought these would be comfortable shoes.  I have a very hard time getting shoes that do not hurt my feet.  I was disappointed in these Skechers work shoes.  They are very hard for the feet.  Not comfortable at all.  Would not recommend, especially if you are on feet all day.  As for slip proof, they work good, just not comfortable.
excelent
Daughter was very pleased with these shoes. Good quality and price. Thx
Way too all
Love the fit amd a very well made shoe..will def. buy again
Hate so uncomfortable. What a waste of money.
Best work shoe I have ever owned. My feet didn't hurt after catering for fourteen hours.
Great. Comfortable.
Love them fit perfect!
2 months and they were already damaged .They were torn on the side couldn't use them any more
Thank you really helps for those long days at work.
These are so comfy!
Really good tread. Im a line cook workef well against oil and water .fit as expected.
very comfortable
I work on my feet all day, and these definitely don't give the support as some other work sketchers I've purchased. Wouldn't buy them again.
I hate to write a bad review on a good shoe, but I write it with an asterisk. At my job when i was on the move they were fine....but when I started cashiering full time at a VERY busy store) after 3 or 4 hours they started killing me. For me, these are NOT GOOD SHOES FOR STANDING. Everything else is fine, but if you're basically standing oin one spot all day it feels like I have a huge nail in each heel. Just torture. So again, moving around....great shoe, comfy, cute (as cute as ugly black work shoes can be) but standing still? DO NOT buy this shoe. ASTERISK**** I am not a small woman. I weigh 200+. So my weight may have something to do with it, I dont know. There are bigger girls than me there who do just fine there, and I am investigating their shoes.
A very comfortable shoe. However, I found the fabric to be on the stiff side which made the shoe rub some on the little toes.
Great slip resistant work shoes, will buy again
I have enjoyed many pairs of Skechers, but this  model was so uncomfortable I threw them out after four tries.  They rubbed blisters, which I have not had a shoe do in years - the floor had no cushioning - really hard on the foot.  I will not buy shoe thru the  mail again.
Most shoes don't fit my heal. But these grip and don't slide at all.Love them.
Love sketches always buy them. But these were terrible. I loved the sleek and no ties look. But they kill my heels after two hours. I even put new insoles. They still stunk there is just no support on the bottom.
No comment
I can't wait to wear these. They're stylish and comfortable, exactly what I wanted.
The support is not as good as advertised.
One of the most comfortable nonslip shoes out there
I bought these for my wife for work. She loves them and they have made a big difference in the way her feet feel when she get home.
Awesome shoes
Love them
They can take a beating but with them you need to invest in some insoles. My feet were killing me after working all day, you have to REALLY break them in just to get comfortable. They have saved my butt with the nonslip while running around the restaurant and in and out of the kitchen so major points there.
I think it's great.it feels great, it looks great and it's just that feeling of a low support at the back of your feet but you actually have a good coverage. my feet's size is in between 7.5 and 8. i took an 8. it was a perfect allowance but i guess i didn't consider that possibility of it loosing its tightness after being worn down. anyways, to sum it all. it's a good buy and i would definitely recommend it
Comfortable but a little bigger than I expected for a size 8.
I take over 50,000 steps a week behind the bar (thanks pedometer) and wear these during every shift. They've been life, back, feet, butt and wallet savers.
Light and comfortable. Great for a job where I'm on my feet all day.
Prime is wonderful, 2 day shipment and delivered on Sunday.. Thank you, and they fit just right. And really hoping the slip proof is good for kitchen floors at a restaurant.. The insoles are good, good heel cushion and I need that. Arch support is good for me cause I have almost flat feet so it's not too high and doesn't hurt.
The shoes came promptly and fit well
They do the job! Love that I don't have to tie my shoes!
I bought this shoes to my mom, fits perfect for she and very comfortable also. She walked a couple of hours with this shoes and really likes the shoes.
These are really comfortable...more that I expected..Glad I bought them
excellent
They are lacking a little in the sole department. Like walking barefoot. I work 12 hour shifts and they aren't doing it for me. The heel is nice but that's about it.
They are very comfortable!!! I love them!!
Were not as comfortable as expected.
It was used previously.
I get these shoes wet a lot so maybe that is the reason but these shoes are starting to fall apart. I think the regular running LIV shapeups actually held up better. I would buy these again though. I really wish skechers had not discontinued this line! These shoes are pretty worn now and I had to buy arch support for them... but I definitely find these the best work shoes. They are lighter than the other shapeups.
Bought these for my aunt who is standing up at work for most of the day. She loves them!
These shoes are great for daily activities as well as improving walking, foot arch shape, and alleviating poor balance when used correctly. The biggest issue I see is folks walking incorrectly (stomping or flapping their feet like a duck in a &#34;V&#34; shape) and then blaming their failure on the shoe. As I myself have resolved my flat feet, these shoes were instrumental in helping me as I re-learned how to walk more correctly. I got new shoes every year, and by the 3rd year I was wearing a full size smaller as my arch became stronger with better walking and more correct use of my feet. For folks with high arch problems, they are more likely to move to larger shoes as their arch relaxes into a more stable and normal arch shape. This shoe doesn't make the change happen but it is great for assisting the process and like any tool, if used incorrectly, it can be ineffective (or for specially talented folks who could burn water, even a bit dangerous).
Find if they had of fit too wide and loose feeling.
I've always had pretty decent luck with Skechers and its support of my heel, but this one just doesn't keep my heel from hurting like my previous pair from the manufacturer. It eventually ripped from the sole within 9 months :(
Had to return them because they were too small...
Comfy shoes! The toe is not as rounded as I thought but still cute.
It needs more arch support
A little bigger then what I thought they would be but not by much. Feel good to where all day at work. Would order again!
I'm a bartender, love these shoes. Breaking them in isn't very fun but my last pair lasted a very long time. To anyone in the industry, I recommend sketchers work. Also, go for a half size smaller than you normally wear. (That's just a sketchers thing)
Very comfortable, super light, easy to wipe clean, and definitely anti-skid.<br />I've owned a lot of work shoes and these are by far my favorite. They're light and fit the best of all Skechers I've had, too. If you're on your feet 12 hours a day you know your feet swell. These allow for that very well.
When I bought these shoes they worked out really good and all but after a few months they hurt my toes along the side and my feet tend to slide downward so it hurts my sole. My heels also ache after a while cuz of the wedge. They are hard on the inside, not very comfortable to do a long shift. However I cannot return them but I won't wear them as often. I wish they would of made them more durable in case you hurt your feet or run them against something hard or sharp. Ok grip for water though, I would wear them in the snow and they are ok as well.
Absolutely love these shoes!!!!
Ouch ! These shoes tore my feet up they are so stiff and hard they made my feet bleed
Love these! Super comfortable! I'm on my feet all day and I would just live in these they're so comfortable. I love the little cushion in the heel. I need a couple more pairs in different colors.
These are really cute comfortable shoes
No padding
I can wear these for 10 hours, but my feet and back still hurt afterwards. They work great as non slip and look really cute.
I love these shoes so much.  I've had them for quite some time and they are some of the most comfortable shoes I own.  I've worn them during air travel and they were perfectly comfortable to wear while carrying a heavy backpack through airports.  The heel is a great height, too, as it doesn't cause my ankles, calves and knees to hurt like a lot of heels do.  They stay on well and don't dig in anywhere and they're nicely padded and they've got good tread.  I only wish all heels were made like these shoes!
fabulous work shoes and stylish for working on feet all day and can wear with dresses
I love these shoes! They are somewhat dressy, yet feel like a sport shoe. Very comfortable.
I gave them to a co-worker who likes them enough. She says she wouldn't wear them all day if she had to stand.
Love the shoe, just slightly too small.
ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼
I'll wear a thicker sock to make sure these don't flap when I walk.
The no slip works pretty well.  But the best part is the don't hurt my feet!  I am on my feet 8-12 hours a day and my feet never hurt with these shoes!
I purchased these shoes because I work on concrete floors all day.  They offer good support and fit as expected.  The leather is a little stiff at first, but they soften up as you wear them.
These are very comfortable soes!
I bought them for work as a server however they are so narrow they pinch my toes and they cause that really uncomfortable scraping on the back on my heels. I bought them true to size but perhaps should have gone a size up.
I think I might be able to use these if I wear them a little bit each day to &#34;break&#34; them in
I love these shoes.  I can wear them all day and my feet don't hurt at all.  They are very comfortable.  They feel like you're wearing nothing on your feet.  They are very light.  I would definitely recommend them as work shoes.  It's wonderful to come home at the end of the day without hurting feet!
I love these shoes.  They look good.  Feel good.  Do run a little large, one foot fits perfectly (left) the other would fall off if I have to run.<br />I know they're work shoes, but a brown shoe would be just as good.  I have not worn them without socks, I suspect they would be a little<br />big if I do.
Good for the price. They run large all around. These were my work boots for 6 months and I use them on raining days to combat the slippery surface I work on.
Nice looking... very painful and uncomfortable fit... 71/2 size
These boots messed up my toenails, they started to push up my big toe in the center and caused them to start splitting down the center. I had to go out and buy new boots for work and it took my toenails a couple of weeks and they started to improve. I feel like I should get a refund because with a problem like that, you would not know to return them right away.
shoes are comfortable, but after wearing it for a couple of months there was a defect in the front at the tip, the shoes begun to rip
I LOOOOOVE these boots! I bought them to work in the kitchen in the restaurant I work in. They are perfect for those wet and damp floors and being in the cooler. They keep my feet dry, don't hurt and are very spacious. I have bunions, so it's important to find comfy shoes. I would recommend these.
Returned
I agree with another reviewer these are the worst fitting Sketchers I have ever purchased! It feels like concert for insoles whatever you do nothing helps!<br />I have a closet full of Sketchers!!
Shoe is very comfortable, but I slip very easily on wet floors.
Bought for mother and she loves them. Her workmates asked where to buy them since they seem to like the design.
I removed the insole to use my own insert.  There's plenty of toe room and a tall enough toe box that my toes don't rub. While the leather is soft, the tongue is stiff, which hurts my ankle but I think that's a fair price to pay for my toes.  I'd like slightly more cush in the ball of my foot, but it's ok. I work in a restaurant, so I'm on my feet a full 8 hrs and I don't cringe at the thought of walking to my car at the end of my shift.
Great
Great work shoes when your on your feet for several hours at a time
I really like these shoes. I had them on all day and they provided great skid resistance in a professional bakery environment. I will order these again.
These sneakers are very comfortable. I need to have support for my feet and these shoes fit that need very well.
For women even though it's selling as men and men sizes
Helps me get through a long work day on my feet most of the day!
excellent
I was surprised at how light-weight they are! Hoping the miracle foam holds up. My feet don't hurt after I take my shoes off!!!
I love them!!!!
Very comfortable shoes.
Even though the size is perfect, the &#34;memory foam&#34; is horrible.
Love these shoes for my job.
I wear an 8 1/2 so I ordered a 9.  Still way too small.
Bought for my daughter who is on her feet all day! Best shoes she has ever worn for work!
Very comfortable I work long hours  they feel so good on your feet
Love them. This my second pair. .
Best shoe I've put on my feet while serving ever. Great support and enough room in the toe so it doesn't rub lile so many do. Will buy again!
What a cheap shoe! Less than a month of wear, and they are falling apart. Do not waste your money.
Everything good perfect A+++++++ thanks
Nice and comfortable. Wife loves them!!
Uncomfortable for the first day, and now I love them.  Been wearing them for several months, sometimes 14 hour days.
Good shoe. I wear for work. This is my 2nd pair in just over a year. Worth it!
Terrible shoe has one little square of memory foam at the heal very uncomfortable sending this product back I do not recommend it to anyone
Not a perfect fit .
These shoes are to tight above my feet. I worn them for 2 weeks hoping they would stretch but it didn't help. I order a different style of skechers that I purchased before with no problems hurting my feet.
These shoes are very comfortable to work in all day.
Small
I have only had these shoes about 2 months and they are coming apart near the toe on the outside near the sole. I feel like I wasted my money.
At last! Very happy to have found this Sketcher width which is larger than the C-width that I have been living with for many years. Big sigh of relief from toes. Thank you.
Fit as expected
Not as comfortable as I was hoping, they rub on my big toe causing a callus to form.  I kneel a lot for work and they pinch the top of my feet, when I do.
The tongue slides around and causes top of foot and ankle irritation, unless tied tightly; otherwise, great fit, stability, and comfortable.
I love these shoes!  They fit perfectly.  As an elderly person who needs to use a cane, I am careful about the shoes I buy.  When I was walking on wet, sleet-covered sidewalks a few weeks ago, I didn't slip once.  When I got inside my apartment, the shoes were completely dry, inside and out.<br /><br />Most shoes hurt my feet, but these shoes are very comfortable, even after several hours of being on my feet, going up and down stairs, etc.
very comfortable
I tried to save money by ordering a less expensive pair of shoes, that will not happen again! Very disappointed in Skechers at this time!
I Feel better Thank You
these shoes are so comfortable. This is the second pair I have gotten, I'm on my feet 8-9 ours a day so comfort is important. I replace shoes every 6-7 months for comfort.
what expected
I really wanted these shoes, but they're far too narrow for my monster feet.
My favorite Food serving pair of shoes EVER!!!  Holds your feet in while you RUN!  Great arch support, as well.  thanks again, Sketchers  I do have to add my own inserts for a bit of comfort.
This is the second pair of these shoes i ordered for my wife. My wife is a property manager for a condo complex so she is on her feet for a few hours each work day, the first pair lasted for 3 years of well worn use, according to her they were comfortable and practical. This second pair are another story, same style. same size completely different fit...actually they didn't fit. They were way too tight and in comparison to the old shoe they are noticeably narrower. Definitely not a good buy this time around, so ill be taking her shopping for an alternative.
This is the 3rd time I bought these shoes. The first time I loved them!! The last 2 purchases are of much lesser quality and terrible gluing on the seam and sole. I will be returning them.
Great quality but tight
Very good for work at Burger King.  This is my third pair and I will continue to buy them as I need them
I bought these shoes because they have the Sketcher name and was hoping for really comfortable work shoes.  They have no support and are very uncomfortable.  Next time I will buy the Payless brand...much better and a lot cheaper
Pretty good shoe. There are others that are more comfortable, but for the price, definitely worth it
A shoe that fits good in size and style!
Great shoe, good price, fast shipping
I love these shoes, I bought them for work. I wear a military style security uniform and these were perfect. It took a couple of days to break in but, now I love them.
The shoes are too hard they put blisters on my toes can I return them
Good
Perfect!
I am loving my skechers for work woman.
I work at a convenient store and I am on my feet for 10+ hours straight. The first two weeks I couldn't ask for a better work shoe, but after that the sole started to separate from the base of the shoe. I know I walk a lot and work 50 hours a week, but still these shouldn't fall apart after 2 weeks! Also, some strings started to stick out from the top :(. I hate fray strings it irks me.
Decent shoes for the price
Shoe run small. Horrible shoe very uncomfortable, a little over an hour of being on my feet I was in paipain. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone.  So unhappy shoe sitting in my closet After one day use.
Sadly these shoes didn't last lie the older style of these. The heal is pulling off after having them for two months.
They tend to make my feet hurt..only because i stand most of the day. ..they are comfortable but so new to me
These are uncomfortable because I have wide feet. The shoe itself is somewhat narrow. I got the size shoe that I usually wear and it was too large. These are tight at the top or the foot and too loose in the back.
If you purchase these order a 1/2 size smaller than what you normally wear. Never had this problem with any of the other sketcher shoes I have bought in the past. They are very comfortable though.
first day wearing these and i work for 15 hrs and my feet only started to hurt in the last couple of hours. and i think that is great considering my feet are breaking them in!! GOOD Non slip and great arch support
Wore the skin off two places on my left foot and one on my right first hour I walked in them.  Since it was outside I cannot return them.  Wasted my money thinking these were going to work for me.
These are great. I work in a busy bar, and I run to the kitchen a lot where there is usually water on the floor. I have not slipped at all.
Not as comfortable as I would like, I should have spent the extra money to get a better pair.
Do not like them.
Love them! Perfect for my Clinical's training!
I like, but it was not what I expected
Item as described
Very comfortable
I wear these shoes for 16 hrs. my feet do not hurt at the end of my work day. they are true to size , I wear a pair of reg socks with them, and they fit perfect. doesn't feel like i have any shoes on.
I bought this shoes for my wife but the six was a little large, now she has to return it and get and smaller size.
I have man feet.  These shoes did not come in wides but some of the reviews said they were wider than normal.  Now typically if I can't find a wide, I get a size 10 and it will be a little snug on the sides but nothing too bad.  These shoes are actually pretty long--like I feel like I am wearing a 10.5, however, they are not wide for a shoe at all.  In fact they are a bit tight.  So if you have flat wide man feet like me, these shoes are too narrow.
Mom loves them
Light weight and comfortable
PLEASE READ....  make sure you order one size smaller.  These shoes run big!!!  I wish I paid attention to another post where he said they run big.  Also they are not wide...I'm getting sores on the side of my small toes.  Other than that they feel great on the bottom of your feet
Way too big, make noise when you walk
Not wide enough and no arch support!
Confortable, fast shipping
sizing chart was wrong, cannot wear these shoes at all
They look big and clunky. They don't do my back any favors. There is a lack of heel support.  I just got a very similar shoe by Dansko. Huge difference. The up side is, you can wear them in wet weather.
They get the job done,  but are a hair too tight.
Foot comes up in back . Fills weird. Besides that shoe good for price
Very comfortable
SOOOOOO......... Not what it looks like on the pic!! Right shoe was way so big and left shoe was to big but not like right! So totally not satisfied period!!! I took em to my job and co-worker(s) also same comments!!! Note in shoe box,,,, up to 50% restocking fee!!!! No sense in sending back!!! Never thought Sketchers could dissatisfy me as I was with this shoe!!!!
My daughter on her feet all day. says it is light walking on air!
Love this shoe
I was real happy to find these and at such a reasonable price. I have worn these just one shift and felt that they were not comfortable on my feet. I stand almost all of the time and found little cushion. My legs were very tired after my shift, to the point that I am back in my tennis shoes the next. Hope this is helpful.
These shoes are mot made very well had only a few months and they are already coming apart will not ever buy again and to those looking to buy dont waste your money
Love these!!
It fits good.
I wear a size 9 1/2 but ordered a 10 and they were too big. They flop around like flip flops in the back due to being too big. The &#34;S&#34; Sketchers emblem on the side had yellow gooey stuff all around it but they look good with scrubs and are comfortable.
Nice shoe but it appears the sizes run large. I have to return.
good
excelent
THESE SHOES ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND DO NOT FIT WELL.<br />WHEN WALKING THEY SLIP RIGHT OFF YOUR FEET
Is not very comfort.
i love it!!!
Bad
Fit 1/2 size bigger  but they're  comfortable
I can only wear them with my extra-thick, wool socks. They're too loose in every direction for my normal socks.
these are OK for the money. I use them to slip on and off to let the dogs out. but as work shoes go, I would say no way. I was a little disappointed for a Sketchers brand.
Too small
I bought a pair of these shoes in black and wore them all winter.  Wanted white for summer.  They are the best I've found so far. I work in health care and on my feet all day.
A little to Big for my feet but a comfortable shoe. Very light weight.
Okay based on the many reviews on how big these shoes run, I ordered a size smaller. I'm normally an 8. I ordered a 7. They just arrived and they are too small. I was able to put them on and walk around my house, but I think they would be uncomfortable for a long period. I have a medium width foot with high arches. The inside seemed soft to me. I had no problems with the lining.<br /><br />I'm returning them for a bigger pair, because I like the way they look. They seem sturdy and nicely made. They do have a slip resistant bottom. I think they are a good value for the price, but you might want to order two pairs (one of each size ) and just return the one that doesn't fit.
But very light comfortable.
Love it,worth every penny it cost
They are confortable.
Arrived on time and in fair shape. The area around the Skecher sign was a slightly discolored but since it wont show anyways not a big deal.fit alot bigger than i expected. I usually wear a 6 and i could have easily fit a 4 or 5 if it would have been available. I sugges ordering a size down from your normal shoe size.
I absolutely LOVE my Skechers Shape-ups and expected to love these but, instead, ended up in pain!  These were a colossal waist of money and painful, to boot!
Compared to the work shoes my company uses these were comfortable I just had to add more insoles because I had foot surgery and need more support. I would definitely recommend these. Plus the price was great compared to other comp toe shoes. I will be buyingmore
A little large, but great work shoes
It's very good product , and comfortable .
Excellent and comfortable too
I work 10 1/2 hours everyday working on concrete floors. These shoes had NO PADDING and hurt my feet so bad that I only wore them 2 days and then went to walmart and bought their cheap women's steel toe (not comp toe) and I have now wore those for 4 days straight with no problem. My work place has just started making us wear steel toes so everybody is comparing the comfort of their shoes. Some have sketchers that have a memory foam padding so my advice is to look for something like that. I gave these 2 stars for price and sizing...comfort I would give a ZERO!!
Everything is as expected.
Skechers makes a good tennis work shoe.
Good shoe
I bought these shoes last December and I wear them three days a week (I work three 12 hour shifts). The soles are falling apart. The front of the shoe is falling apart. I have to keep cutting off the tread on the sole because it is pulling apart from the shoe. The &#34;slip resistant&#34; part is horrible. What happened was that when walking in snow, the snow would get packed up into the tread forming dense, almost like a ball, layer of snow. This made it so it not only was NOT slip resistant, but actually more slippery. I hate these shoes. Do not buy if you live where you will be walking through snow. Also, do not expect them to last for more than a year.
Love these shoes.
Comfortable!
Love these shoes fit as expecte
great shoes, takes a few days to break in to be comfortable though
Excellent
my friend mistake it for athletic shoes, so it is too heavy
If your not the heavy boot type then these are perfect! Sizes run a slight large but thats ok! So the composite is not squeezing your feet.
They are awesome! They fit well. I'm 50 and on my feet for 8 hrs a day. Very comfortable and non skid!
I'm on my feet 8 hrs of the day after 2 days of wearing them at work I went back to my old shoes
It is true to size. I didn't expect it to be slightly narrow on the sides for a safety shoe. I should have purchased wide toe but it wasn't available. It is comfortable and very appealing.
good buy
great work shoes and very comfortable.
I thought Skerchers would be a great shoe, given their popularity. NO!  These shoes were extremely uncomfortable, they had no padding for the foot and the sole was very hard.<br /><br />The shoe looked good and it fit good, but lacked comfort.  I am on my feet all day and could not wait to get them off after my day ended.  I do not recommend this shoe at all.  I went back to my other brand SFC, the shoes I purchased had a great padded insole and were very comfortable.
Started to wear after the first month. The comp toe is light weight, but there isn't enough padding in the shoe, so it rubs the sides of your feet. I feel like I wasted my money. I need a new comfortable shoe that I can be on my feet all day in.
shoes are horrible! im so dissapointed with this purchase! I wore them once and they hurt my feet horribly! theyre super heavy and have steel toe which is no good for anything! i asked for my money back and they denied my return ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ $80 gone to the trash! DO NOT BUY!
They run like one size bigger
Good shoe kind of heavy to wear on a 8 to 12 hour shift but meets the required policy's that my job expects for your dress code. And not goofy looking like a lot of the shoes that are non slip job required shoes. Thank u
Wear thick socks with them! They rub the big toe a bit.
It took a LOT of breaking in to get these shoes to where I could wear them an entire work shift--I had to change shoes mid-shift a few times, they were that bad.  I absolutely had to buy insoles as they were very uncomfortable as they were, and it was like walking directly on the floor.  The insoles made them bearable, but they still were not kind to my feet--they still cause callouses on my big toes, but I rotate them with another pair of shoes for work, and I tend to not wear these on my longer work days.  They are a heavy pair of shoes, so your legs will be a bit tired until you get used to them.  I will say that they are GREAT for protecting your toes, and the slip- and shock-resistant features fit in well with my work. I like the style and colors, but I believe from now on I will only be purchasing shoes in person, not online.  As some others posted, they do run large--I usually look for the wide shoes, but I may have been okay with a regular width for this particular shoe.
I love them!
I ordered wide and they came saying extra wide, never heard of it, so not sur eif that is why they fit a little big, just tie shoes tight and I am off. Not my favorite composite toe from sketchers, but it seems I find one and next thing you know they are not making them anymore. Need more options when buying womens work shoes please!
great
Great shoe fits right with extra space im a 6.5
This is only the second day wearing them but they are way more comfortable than the other shoes I have been trying. I work in a warehouse on a concrete floor and stand/walk for most of the day.  I can still wear them at the end of the day. My only complain so far is the laces, they just dont stay tied. They are the round tube like laces and are very slippery. Maybe with wear and tear they will get better.<br /><br />For the price I think they are great. They don't look bad for work shoes! Sketchers have always been good to my feet.
Too small and sole to hard for being on ur feet  for 10 to 12 hours
Ran very small. Sent back
Skechers are the most comfortable shoes normally but the toe box is too narrow and the composite toe squeezes your feet on both sides would order wide if you are thinking of getting these. They aren't as cushioned on the bottom as my other sketchers they are a lot lighter than steel toe.
The quality of the shoe is good. It was just to narrow or my wide feet. But if it came in wide width I would rethink about purchasing them if they put some memory foam in the inside solo. They are not comfortable at all .
The comp toe makes the shoe less flexible. It really isn't a good shoe for walking constantly which is what I do.
Everything I expected from Skechers! Only work shoe I would wear!
You'll have to replace the inner soles pretty quickly but otherwise they're a nice sturdy pair of boots,
Nice!!!
I ordered the same size as I have in regular Sketcher her tennis hoes and these were way to big! They run very big in size! The quality seems very good! Very lightweight for a composite toe work shoe.
There are a steel toe shoe in these and I did not want that. Only slip resistant was what I needed. Disappointed.
Works great for work. Very comfortable, great ankle support. Good grip for slippery surfaces and look good!
I will order a smaller size next time.
Fits and feels good ! I'm on my feet close to 16 hrs a day and they don't hurt as bad as other shoes I've tried!
I just received my new sketchers were nonslip work shoes.<br />I tried them on. They are a perfect fit, and are very comfortable. Thank you sketchers you've done it once again
These are great shoes.  There was no pain from the beginning so I did not need to soften the leather with temporary wear.
Great buy.  I always buy D'kites.
I did not even need my shoe supports inside as I did with my other shoes.
I love Sketchers because they accept my orthodics perfectly and they are the best sturdy and support shoes I have ever bought!! I tell everyone about them! And the price for these was great! I am very pleased...thank you
I would like them more if they had more cussing. I stand on my feet for six hours and at the end of the day my heels hurt. Plus they don't fit like my other Sketches in the same size, they are a little short.
Nice shoes
Shoes wear comfortable
My daughter loves these for work.  Good quality, fair price, nice look. And that's saying a lot coming from my 17 year old.
Great shoes at a great price
Perfect for work, comfortable- and very nice to the eye.  love
These I wear at work all day long, super comfortable with great arch support
Not comfortable at all
good
Hurts my feet still after almost 2 months
good
I had originally purchased the Skechers for work but they were so nice I decided to use them for pleasure instead! They looked as good as my regular Skechers, the fit was perfect, the price was right, and they are very comfortable.
Got a good deal and wear them 9 1/2<br />Hours at work on concrete floors.
Just wished they compared to the original store i needed them from. My company store Safeway
I â¤ï¸ my new shoes they are Great in a Dishroom in the wet they stand up
I have worn Skechers Work shoes for years, but not the Work D'Lites.  I decided to try these for the first time, and I was disappointed.  I feel, they are a little tighter fitting in general. ( I always liked this brand because they tend to have a more comfortable fit and are durable shoes )  Understanding that these are made for work, and may be tighter for stability, the other ones never felt tight.  My feet and legs ache toward the end of the day, which is probably a result of the uncomfortable fit.  The biggest disappointment came though, about a month and a half after I got them.  They've already started coming apart!  I've never had a pair of skechers work shoes, or other shoes come apart so soon.  I would still recommend Skechers, just not the work D'Lites'
Okay for the price. I use it for running.
A little narrow for me
I ORDERED THESE SNEAKERS FOR MY FRIEND. SHE SAID THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE. FAST SHIPPING. SHE HIGHLY RECOMMENDS! !
I wear them to work all the time!!
These are very lightweight but the toes are uncomfortable. At this price, I am keeping them. Hoping they break in.
Length of shoe was perfect, but shoes are slightly narrower in the toe area than expected. The shoes lightly pinch my little toe which is mildly irritating and can get painful as the day wears on. Im a dietary manager and im very happy with the non slip. We have newly waxed floors and i havent slipped at all.Better quality than shoes for crews!
K
Very co<br /><br />Very comfortable love them<br /> definitely slip resistant
The only shoes I'll wear for work.  As a CNA  I'm on my feet all day and these shoes are the most comfortable I've found.  The non slip sole is great for floors that are constantly wet from being washed...and spills.
I bought a pair of New Balance and hated them.  I had an older style of these and wanted another pair.  I love them!
Narrow Narrow Narrow!! These are awful! There is no comfort to these shoes at all! Extremely disappointing! These shoe pinch everywhere and are way to narrow! There is no cushion at all. I walk all day for my work and I couldn't stand to have these on for 10 minutes in the living room! Horrible!
Comfortable and I can wear for hours. The shoes are non slip.
These are my go-to sneakers!  I just love Skechers you just can't go wrong with anything named Skechers!  I've been wearing these for more than 10 years and I'm sure I'll be wearing them for the rest of my life.
The shoes were okay, but because of ankle problem I have with my right ankle, I couldn't wear them. I ended up giving them to my niece and she loves them.
There is a seam at the front of the shoe that rubs agains my small toe.  Makes it very hard to wear the shoes for a long period of time.
Skechers are the only sneakers I can wear and I know the size is the same with each pair, no matter the style.
Too heavy and uncomfortable after 2 hours.  One shoe worse than other in fit. Would not buy Skechers again. Too much for below average quality.
Not as comfortable as my last 10 pairs of Skechers. Binds across the top.
I love these shoes. When the store didn't have my size, I turned to Amazon. I work 10 hour days 5 days a week and these shoes save my back.
very comfortable shoes, love sketchers brand, never disappointed
Good shoe
Fits great ...very comfy. ..
I love
The enforcement in the toe makes them a bit uncomfortable if you have wide feet like me.
Best Work shoes I ever purchased! Very comfortable, light weight great Fit.
Too hard to work all day
I ordered a extra wide, but the toes of these shoes fit small.  Great looking, but very uncomfortable.
This is the 2nd pair of these that I have had. Even wearing them to work (I work in a factory) the 1st pair lasted about a year and I'm going on about 6 months on the 2nd. I will definitely buy these again.
MUY BUENO
Great quality! Looks amazing and protect your feet!
Despite the for the composite/steel toe came so far up and pressed on the top and outside of my foot so badly I couldn't even entertain the idea of wearing them for a 8-12 hour day. Immediately returned. I love Sketchers BOOTS but their shoes are nothing alike.
While the arch support isn't amazing, it's not been such a bother that I've needed to put in inserts. I wear them comfortably for sometimes 16 hours a day, and I would buy them again.
They fit as expected and are very comfortable!  I love them,
My feet have been killing me from wearing other saftey show brands, but these shoes are wonderful. The toe pain went away ASAP--I did go up 1/2 size larger & I am very happy with the fit. I plan on buying more of this style when I can--good work shoe for concrete & if you are on your feet most of the day.
They are extremely uncomfortable. The steel toe digs into your feet wicked bad!! Worst pair I have even owned
I got the wide width and they are not as wide as my precious pair of shoes.  Hurt my big toe by end of day....they are cute tho
Still too tight bought 3 pairs and all too tight.
a little big but comfy
Not all that comfortable, but they are very sturdy.
These are great service work shoes! I love the slip resistant of them. I can mop a 400 sf tile floor and have no issues walking across it. The only problem I have with them is that they don't have the arch support that other Skechers tennis shoes have... I did have to order 1/2 smaller size after the normal size I wear was too big. The safety toe on this is a very nice addition. They are a bit on the heavy side, but the features of them out weight that small fact.
they were too narrow and I returned them.
These shoes are comfortable because I got a extra wide be steel toe comfort is hard to find
Love my work shoes.
Its the only brand I wear!!
would of been a good shoe but I did not know they were still toe shoe so I had to send back
love my new work shoes for the first time ever! thanks!
Ok
Ordered half a size larger than I normally wear and she is a bit snug
So far I really like them. I work in retail and need a good shoe. And so far they are great!
Seems to be a little  tight hopefully. They will loosen up other than that I love them the price was amazing. The last one I brought was 20.00 higher will definitely  order again
They take a while to break in
Very affordable shoes. Slip resistance is great, but did have a small issue with toes rubbing.
Nice shoes, great fit.
Excellent fit, comfort and safety.
Super!!!
They do not have a removable insole, only problem.
Nice
Smaller then other Sketchers.
Just as I expected thank you!
Returned right away.  No arch support.  I could feel my foot rolling inward as soon as I tried them on.
Item was as advertised.
They are actually non-slip plus very very comfy.I am a server I am in love with this shoes
I love these shoes. I am a server, very comfortable with great non-skid. They are true to size. I wear a 9 in all of my athletic shoes. Very true to size.
This is the most comfortable Skechers I have had to dateðŸ˜Š I have no pain in my back, legs or feet while wearing these shoes.
good
Very confortable
My new favorite work shoes.  I wear them all day and they are as comfortable at the end of they day as they were when I put them on.
I'm a chef with most of my days 10+ hours and these help me forget that my feet are way over used. Soles are also very good slip resistant! Skechers work shoes will be in my closet from here on out.
I absolutely LOVE these shoes. Ive been serving for almost a decade and these by far are the most comfortable non slip work shoes ive ever purchased. Provide awesome support!
Great for a day and then they started hurting my feet
Great shoes! I wore them for 8 hours on my hospital shift on the first day and they were super comfortable.
They fit perfect, but I wish the memory foam was a bit thicker.
The shoe is a very comfortable fit but the memory foam insole is so thin that you can't really feel it. It feels hard when you walk and has no cushion or support. If it had a better insole I would love these shoes but after walking for a hour my feet already hurt. I don't think you should have to buy new insoles for a brand new pair of shoes. I used to love skechers but after the last couple of pairs I've bought I can tell that they are not made the same anymore. They are made much cheaper and are more uncomfortable.
Great fit. Once you get used to the low profile and lightweight feel they are fabulous. This my second pair.
The most  comfortable  shoe I have  ever bought.
These shoes are amazing. I am on my feet for 13 hours a day. I feel like I'm not wearing shoes with these.
These shoes feel great, go with anything casual, and (according to my daughter) don't look like old-lady shoes.  Not that I'm an old lady!!!
I took a chance on these shoes for my Mom. She's very particular about her work shoes (8-10 hours a day on her feet) and very hard to please, but when she tried this shoe, she said &#34;Wow! These shoes are so comfortable! Can you order me ANOTHER pair?&#34; I was not only surprised, but very happy INDEED!!
Very comfortable for wearing on long days in the kitchen. Easy to wear, the shoes itself weighs very little which makes it easier to get around.
too large
These shoes are great!!  This is by far the most comfortable work shoes I have ever owned and this new model is a slip on instead of the laces which they had before, couldn't get any better than this!!  The nonslip sole really works as long as you make sure your sole I clean.
Returned too tight
OMG!  One of the best pairs of work shoes I have EVER owned.  So light and breathable.  The wide fit was perfect to allow for swollen piggies.  I am very pleased with these shoes and  I hope they last a very long while.
bad smell
Very good work shoe for the price. Nice cushiony insole and light weight. The nonslip outer sole proved reliable on slippery floors. My only complaints would be not offering the shoe in half sizes and wide, and lack of support for lateral movement. I pronate inward so my knees ache a little at the end of a long shift. I do like the lace up feature to accommodate shoes that stretch out. I often end up slipping out of other pairs after too much wear. I use this shoe as a waitress working 5-8 hours a night, 5 days a week. I run during the day and these shoes seem to really baby my feet at night.
Simply amazing
Great shoes. I work for the post office and I am on my feet all day. Some days over 10 hours, and these shoes don't hurt my feet at all. I didn't even need to break them in. They are not exactly my type of shoes (I think they are ugly), but so is every shoe that is approved for work.
GREAT
Did not fit,
Feel like barefoot shoes. I bought the Dr Scholls Active inserts and that helped a lot. I like how light they are. Not big and bulky like some work shoes.
Love these shoes ... So comfortable!! Just the price hadn't tripled after I bought them. Would've orders more.
very nice shoes. great service!
Perfect fit!
Great shoes!!  Very comfortable for work.  Would recommend this seller!!
I bought these for my daughter. She waitresses while going through college.  she would complain of aching feet after working. I don't hear anymore complaints. She tells me they're Comfortable for a long shift.
Love them really comfortable
Love them!!!!!!!
I ordered these for my mother, who is on her feet all day while at work. She had a  similar pair that she'd worn out. The older ones didn't have memory foam insoles like these, so she was pleasantly surprised. She said they looked to be good quality and felt great.
These shoes were a pleasant surprise. I didn't think they would fit because the shoe looks quite narrow, and it is a little on the narrow side. The good thing is that they have a lot of give. The material is not very breathable so that is a drawback, but they make up for it with comfort. I have knee issues, and I'm on my feet for sometimes 9 hours at a time walking and standing. This is my fourth pair of shoes in about 6 months trying to find something that don't add to my pain. I can work a whole shift with minimal issues. They are super light too. The only reasons that I didn't give 5 stars is because they are a little narrow and not breathable so my feet tend to sweat a little after a long shift. PS I've been wearing them now for about 2 weeks and all's well. If anything changes, I'll update my review!
I'm a 15 year server/bartender/manager... I work 6 days a week and 40-50 hours a week at a faced paced high volume restaurant.  I have to say that I'm guilt of repeatedly buying crappy Payless or walmart nonslip shoes over and over because I don't want to spend money on stupid work stuff.  But then o won an amazon gift card and I thought... what the hell I'm gonna buy better shoes... and it was the best decision I've ever made.  They are light and comfy from day one.  No breaking in to do.  I've had them for over a month now and haven't had foot pain yet!  I have slightly wide feet and they are a perfect fit.  I tell all my coworkers to stop buying crap nonslip because with the amount that you have to replace them you could've got one good pair. I like the style too.  I wear skinny Jeans and certain shoes look stupid. ..but these look cute.  Thanks!!
Comfortable & they don't look like &#34;granny shoes&#34;
Quite comfortable.
Stated to be soft but they are hard and slip around when you walk.  I can't go down a size because they are too tight in the toes.
Comfortable and love the memory foam! I don't even have to wear my insoles. Love the slip on feature too!
I have bought the same size twice before but this last pair seemed smaller and less comfortable so I don't wear them much
Bought these for nursing school as they were perfect for the requirements...non skid, solid white (I just cut off the black and pink rubber piece), and safely covered my toes.<br />My concern was that they wore very quickly, in places they shouldn't have... The seams came loose in places, the glue from the shoes was easily visible, and the insoles began to wear and came loose, which eventually led to wear in the inner heel of the shoe, underneath the manufactured sole.<br />I do understand that in this field, over a period of time, wear is expected. However, I only wore these shoes on the weekend for 15 months, and the wear began as early as 6 months after.
Love them
I love these shoes.......I can wear them all day!!
I go these for work, which I start next week. I wore them around the house comfortably a couple times for an hour or so. I don't see why they won't support this lunch lady's body all day!
Was surprised that the inside of the shoe is slippery unless you wear super thick socks.
These shoes killed my feet!!!  The soles were like walking on concrete!! They were also heavy and kept sticking to the floor. If you are on your feet all day, I don't recommend these shoes.
I'm a nurse and walk all day. I've been wearing Skechers athletic shoes for work for 20 years because they are comfortable and offer great support for my feet and legs. This style is new to me and they were comfortable all day from the first day I wore them.
Love these shoes! Very comfortable. Should have gotten two pair.
great non slip shoe. this is my 3rd pair.
Wore them to work--easy to do all of the walking I do throughout the day.  Comfortable & supportive--a good choice.
My shoes fit as they should, just my size, nice shoes.
They are falling apart after a month
I bought these for walking. They do the trick.<br />They are so comfortable that I have forgotten to change them before going out to do errands.
I have never had a more comfortable working sneaker than these. I start work as an RN on Monday and thought about looking into different types of &#34;nursing shoes&#34;. I decided to stick with what I know already works. I love Skechers and always will.
Feel pretty clunky on my feet. Heavy and no instep support.
Wife loves these for daily use at a dental office.  She's on here feet constantly and loves these.  Lots of support.
These are awful. I cannot wear these through an entire shirt without having to take them off. They are so hard and stiff that they make my toes tingle and eventually go numb when standing for long periods.
Great work shoes for a nurse on her feet a lot. Only shoes I will buy, I keep coming back for more, every time I need a new pair. Comfortable and look great !!!!
k
Nice white shoe. A little bulky
I've only had them for a few months and there is already a hole in the seam.
nice
I love these!!! They look and feel great.
But order 1 Size larger!! My size was out so I ordered a size larger, and I am thankful I did!!! mine fit perfect and I LOVE THEM!!! They have extra support and hug your feet without being too tight!
Very disappointed in the hold up of these shoes. The &#34;leather&#34; material has creased and worn so quickly in just over a month. Also the toe of the shoe has split from the leather material leaving a hole in the top. Would definitely not recommend for nursing environments.
I buy a new pair every Spring
I got this for my daughter as her daily school shoes. It fits her comfortably and she wears them all day in school. The support is also good so she does not get feet aches or sores t the end of the day. We love that it's a nice and classy looking leather finish.
Shoes lost absorbing ability after 2 hour shifts. Wouldn't recommend
Fits fine.  Sketches are comfy shoes
It's a good shoe, but I much prefer the Skecher's D'Lites.
Love them
Fast shipping! Great product!!!
These shoes seemed fine for length and width, but there was no apparent arch support.  The insole was very firm and flat.  I only put the shoes on, but did not walk around in them or try to wear them &#34;as long as I could&#34; comfortably&#34;.It was obvious the lack of arch support would be a problem, and was disappointing to me.  I cannot understand a shoe of this type lacking a good arch support.  I could not be sure that if I went and bought another insole with arch support, that the shoe would then fit properly in other areas.  Another issue, though not a deal breaker if the insole had been properly configured, is that the leather is more cream colored, while the laces and lining are stark white, which appears a bit odd. The quality and durability of the shoes, other than as mentioned above, appeared excellent, but a shoe that lasts for years, yet does not fit properly isn't acceptable to me.
Love it,love it,love it!! Most comfortable gym shoe yet!
had to post them back because the shoe size in uk is 5 that I purchased going by the us shoe size which was 7.5 the us size was wrong going by the chart on amazon.had to order another pair us size 8 for uk size 5 and i'm out off pocket because of the price Â£16.35 for postage from uk as I was only getting $15.00 postage back not happy.
I was disappointed in the footbed. For a work shoe I thought it would be much more softer. I am returning the shoes and going to order the &#34;softies&#34;. I have bought the softies twice now and liked the shoe. Just wanted to try something else, but I'm going to go back to the reliable softie. Thanks so much. They looked like a well made shoe.
Great
Exactly what I expected.  So far very happy with my purchase.
I do not think the issue is with the shoes, as much as with my balance.  Although I can use many shoes, these made it hard for me to walk in.  Again, I think this is me and not the shoe.
I didn't purchase these from amazon but instead from a local shoe store chain. I have had these now for 5 weeks and I have regretted them from about 2 weeks after buying them. I was hoping that i simply needed to &#34;break them in&#34; but 5 weeks later they still feel horrid. I will be donating these shoes to a local thrift store in hopes that someone else will be able to enjoy them. I do suffer from planters factitious but I had never had too too much of an issue with comfort during work until these.  My friends and family kept telling me to get a pair of Merrill's but since I had always gotten Sketchers I didn't want to spend $100 on a pair of work shoes. Needless to say, I just placed my order for Merrill's. These shoes can burn for all I care but I will be donating them as soon as my Merrill's come in.
I like this shoe but they are not as comfortable as the next grade up shoe. I like more cushion in my work shoes.Look, fit, and comfort is good for the 3 months that I will wear them at work.
Needed a comfortable steel toe shoe for work. These shoes are great!
I'm a FOOD SERVICE worker...This shoes are perfect !!!!!!!!!!! :)  I love it ! Look great too !!!
Best work shoes ever
They were what I thought they were, inexpensive steel toed non leather shoes.<br /><br />I used these as plate shoes for baseball umpiring, as NB refuses to make real plate shoes small enough. I've worn these maybe sixty times for anywhere from 2 to 6 hours per use. They took a good amount of sprinting down the lines on those days but I wouldn't say they took any abuse. I noticed on one of the last days I wore them this season that they are already coming apart at the seams up front. I didn't expect miracles from these shoes but not even to last a season is disappointing. I'll wear them for fall ball but I'll have to look elsewhere for something for next year.<br /><br />Be aware that these shoes are HOT! They don't breath at all and are made of some sort of rubber or synthetic leather so they really keep in the heat. I only put them on at my car right before a game and took them off immediately after and never wore them while working as base umpire. With time in between wearing I was able to air them out frequently but if you plan on wearing them for a full time job, these are definitely not the shoes for you and could become a breeding ground for foot issues.
They squeak!!
These need more support inside. While they work great for me for working as a plate umpire for softball, they are just not comfortable. After my second game my feet hurt and I need to get out of them.
These are my work shoes and they are great.
Where the steel ends, rubs against my big toe on both shoes due to them not being quiet wide enough.
Amazing !!
Steal toe seemed to be positioned in the wrong spot and uncomfortably poked my foot.  I will be returning them
I bought these to wear as  walking shoes for a trip that includes many hours of touring.  The very thick soles and memory foam are so much better than my sneakers.  My thinking is that if these are worn as work shoes (think service industry:  restaurant workers, massage therapists, etc.) they should be very comfortable and supportive for my purposes.<br /><br />I wore them all day indoors on hard porcelain tile floors.  I was standing for much of the time.  My feet felt fine, my legs didn't hurt, and my back got the support it needed.<br /><br />No matter what your reason is for buying these shoes, if you anticipate many hours on your feet, I recommend these Skechers for Work Women's Felix Doozer Work Shoes.
With the steel toe the toes area is very tight and uncomfortable.
Very good for work
I've always heard Sketchers was a good work shoe so I decided to give them a try. These are the most comfortable steel toes I've ever worn. I think I'll buy me another pair for later .. I am now a big Sketchers fan . I highly recommend these shoes...
I have been looking for a good, supportive steel toe shoe for quite some time; last pair I bought were men's in size 7.5 -too anxious in purchase of this pair.  Working on cement floors all day kills your legs and knees.... this pair of Skechers  is GREAT.
The steel toe portion cuts into my toes.  Only wore them for about an hour....then had to take them off.  Waste of money....will never order shoes on-line again!!!
Very comfortable
They r fine never had a problem
Satisfied with shoes.
good
Thank you.. Good shoe and good price. Would Recommend and buy again.....Aloha
This is my third time buying these.  I stand/walk all day...very comfy
Received item in a quick fashion and as expected.
These shoes are great. Feel real good on my feet.
...these shoes came with one shoe all bent inward kind of narrow on the inside to where the steel toe part digs into the top of your toes giving my wife blisters and eventually slicing the top of her toes...she could'nt even wear them for a full week at work....I felt like I hurt her buy buying em for her...So no stars for a bad experience..SMH
They arevery<br /><br />They feel very comfortable. I love the color of the shoes
Perfect!
These shoes are so comfortable I feel like I am walking on pillows!
Very, very comfortable shoes...
Love these shoes, I work in automotive plant, work around oil, on my feet all day, they are so comfortable , would recommend these shoes if your looking for comfort, slip resistant, steel toeðŸ˜Š
Very pleased with these shoes.  I wear a size 8, but I ordered a size 8.5 due to the steel toe, and they fit perfectly.  The inserts are comfortable as well, but I don't expect them to last long. Whenever I do have to buy new inserts I think the shoe will be just as comfortable since the shoes are a half size larger.  Overall I am happy with the style and comfort of this, think it was a great purchase.
I am on my feet for 10 hours a day and these are great. The only downside is they are a bit heavy but that is because of the steel toes. That also means the heat is held in which will be great in the winter. These shoes provide great support and my feet do not hurt anymore. The tongue was stiff on one shoe and it took a couple of days to break the material in so it didn't dig into the front of my foot. Overall these are the best non-slip shoes I have ever owned and at a bargain!
awesome!!! very comfy
Awesome love these shoes and the ion coating is great. Had to get some memory foam insoles and now they are perfect!
A very comfy pair of work shoes.
Very comfortable. Great for work or casual. Even with the Steele toe. Love the way all Skechers fit.
I put theses on and don't want to take them off! I actually wore them out to eat. They matched my outfit perfectly. Everyone at work notices them and wants them too!
Very comfortable, roomy but not loose. Sturdy and well-made. Not a lot of cushion in the footbed but I use an orthotic anyway. Highly recommend.
Surprisingly very comfortable shoe for being steel toed.  I wear them from 6:00 am to 2:30 and sometimes forget to take them off before I leave to go home.  Love the gel foam insoles!!!
I bought this shoes for work and it make my foot hurt so bad that I couldn't way to get home and take out<br />I was very disappointing I never thought the sport or tennis shoes it can make you feel such bad painðŸ˜”ðŸ˜ðŸ˜–<br /><br />Pss: I have to rating to be avel to sent this email, so I put one star, but I want to make it clear this shoes don't even deserve half of star
Not very comfortable. They are very flat and a little large to size. I got 2 huge blisters after wearing them to work one day.
i like these because they are both stylish and good work shoes at the same time. you can't go wrong with skechers non slip.
They are great, sturdy shoes but anyone who needs arch support may have to buy inserts.
I purchased these shoes for the casual appearance and later found they have horrible traction for working in restaurants. I only work 30 hours a week and the sole started to come apart after two months of wearing them. I should have sprung the extra money for a pair of shoes for crews in a similar style.
Less than a month in they started tearing up. The shoelace eyelets came loose and they had holes on the inside. Don't wear white socks with these. The dye will run on the socks and discolor them. Don't waste your money!
I really like them, the style and comfort but I have to wear them with thicker socks so they don't rub the back of my feet.
I am very happy with the purchase of this shoe! It's so hard to find a cute, comfortable, work-approved shoe but this matches all three! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for all day comfort in a stylish design that your boss will approve of too. My co-workers were shocked when I told them these were actually Skechers and not Converse. Go Skechers!
Good for work as long you put in extra cushion/padding. I am a server, my feet are my engine, have to take care of them.
I absolutely love these shoes! They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day at work!  Update: okay I'm so disappointed it been two months and I already need new ones? I work at a coffee shop nothing with crazy labor. This is ridiculous. I'm definitely calling customer support.
WOW! I am so glad I came across these shoes. It has been difficult for me to shop for appropriate work shoes in the small town I live in so I have been buying the same ugly, black, Croc-like clogs from Walmart for over a year now.<br /><br />As a casual dinning server I am on my feet all day and adding that it is at a seafood restaurant where butter is plentiful, and often times all over the floor by the end of our guests meals, I can say the grip is very good and the shoes are comfortable.<br /><br />I try to replace my shoes every three months or so as needed (that seemed to be when the Walmart clogs seems to lose their &#34;springiness&#34; to them and made it harder on my legs and back) but I will definitely buy these again! Not only are they more comfortable to wear than my last shoes, they are just as easy to clean (I just toss them into the washing machine/air dry once every couple of weeks so they don't get smelly) and they are more stylish than those ugly clog things.<br /><br />If you need extra arch support I am sure it is nearly always better to get shoe inserts to accommodate, but as far as inexpensive and slip resistant shoes go I consider these top notch!
My job implemented a new policy in February requiring everyone to have slip resistant shoes. I bought these because of the Converse-like look to them. At first, I loved them and they were perfect. That is, until the treads started to crumble off of the bottom less than a month into wearing them. Yes, I do spend a lot of time on my feet at work but that's mostly indoors and standing on hardwood or soft rubber flooring. I looked past that because the shoes fit great and got the job done but no more than a few weeks later the soles started to separate and the shoes began &#34;talking&#34;. My socks are exposed at the front and back of the shoe and different pieces and fragments now come off the inside of the heels every day. They were as good as gone in under three months. Granted I did not spend a fortune on them, but I didn't expect them to fall apart so badly. I'm only five feet tall and basically petite so I wouldn't consider myself to have hard on them at all. Great if you only need a short run out of them. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
Great for work. And cute
Love, love, love these shoes!  I have a hammer toe and a bunion, skechers are sooooo comfortable!!!
Thanks they fit well and now I don't have to ruin my good shoes anymore
Bought these on cyber Monday as a non slip shoe for the restaraunt I work in. In the past five months I've slipped and sprained my ankle twice.
They run Alittle large so did order a 7.5 and should receive new ones within a couple days and then will either sale the 8 to co worker or return them..
I'm actually sending these back because I needed nonslip shoes for work, but these were not nonslip. They arent comfortable either. I really expected better from how they looked but was disappointed.
Loved it! Wear it at least twice weekly, comfortable and sturdy. Easy to clean and durable. I'm purchasing another pair!
The first pair of these shoes I ordered lasted me a year+. This second pair I recieved in May and the sole is falling off already!! NOT non-skid on Spanish tile either(I work in a Mexican restaurant).
Great product, my only recommendation is if you have wide feet, get half a size larger than your normal size
Definitely slip proof. The footbed needs more padding. Need to buy insoles. Not flat foot friendly.
great product!
They lasted me no more than a month. Soles tore off at the heel. Have always skechers work shoes and never had a  problem with any of them. Disappointed in the pair.
Wouldn't recommend for someone buying these at a fast food restaurant. They ate not water resistant and I slipped with every step I took at work
So I bought these when I started my job at Chipotle and they wanted us to buy Non-Slip shoes. Everyone purchased their shoes from ShoesForCrews, but they are all very unattractive. These were the best of the worse. I changed the laces to give them some color, and I feel a big difference when I go to work in these and when I go in normal shoes. The only thing is, make sure you clean out the treads or the smell is awful. When it comes time to replace mine, I will definitely be back to buy these again.
These weren't as slip resistant as I thought they would be. I was sliding around everywhere while some of my coworkers were walking normal. Wore them about thirty hours a week for ten weeks and they were worn down enough that I would need a new pair.
I purchased these for my daughter to wear to work. She is a waitress and is on her feet all day long. These give her support and comfort. The non-slip bottoms are a huge added benefit! These are trendy, affordable, and comfortable! Love them!!
GREAT SHOES!
They are cute and comfortable but I slide everywhere in the kitchen! One patch of water and I am going down. The Walmart version of these are so much better. They look the same, cost less, and are effective.
Not comfortable.
Cute sneakers, but they're really not meant for working in, despite the fact that they are Skechers &#34;work&#34; shoes. Terrible support, uncomfortable, and the lining inside of the heel is coming apart after wearing them for less than 2 weeks. Epic fail, Skechers Work!
I bought these shoes 3 months ago for work, and the sides already ripped. A friend of mine bought the same shoes and the same thing happened.<br />These are not inexpensive shoes compared to similar brands. I would defintly advise buying an off brand, because they will last the same amount of time as these sketchers
Cute and comfortable work shoes. The only issue is that they are not that slip-resistant. I've slides many times in these shoes compared to my old shoes. Slip-resistant enough to pass for wearing at work, but definitely not great.
They fell apart after 2 weeks into Starbucks barista use.
Wow these suck. I was slipping and sliding almost falling all day. Waste of money. Go with shoes for crews like I should have done to begin with
I don't have any problems wearing them for an 8 hour shift. I did need to put in arch supports because they are very flat. But I put them in all my shoes.
Terrible.  Slip everywhere.  Blisters on both feet.  Should be zero starts.
Thanks
With in 2 weeks of getting these shoes they started to fall apart, peices of the bottom are tearing off, the inside at the heels are so worni can see whats beneath the fabric. Beside them falling apart so quickly, they are good shoes. i stil wear them regardless. they are comfotable to me, but dont tie them too tight if you decide to get them.
The worst product I have ever purchased.  If you're looking for non slip shoes, look elsewhere.  These are all false advertising,  and no delivery on the purpose of these.  What a waste.
Do not buy. They are not non slip. Didn't make it 20 minutes at work before I had to change. I have returned them b
Excellent product fast shipping
I don't prefer to give ratings when I haven't tried out the merchandise yet but as far as appearance and fit, these are wonderful. I have not yet worn them to do work yet but I hope to be able to update my rating afterwards which will be in about a month when I actually break them in for the first time.
Purchase them for her work as a part of a work uniform they fit great
wore these shoes to work every day for two years. they were comfy and stylish. they were a little too big, but not enough to bother me. I would definitely buy them again. Skechers makes the best non slip work shoes.
Material inside the heal wore away pretty quickly, otherwise no complaints
I purchased these shoes for working at a fast food restaurant and I slip nonstop. They are no comfortable whatsoever also.
These shoes are not non slip!<br />I'm sliding all over the place in my kitchen!<br />These are unsafe!
I really like the look of these shoes and talking about slip resistant they are ok but could be better
While the design of these work shoes is great, I was disappointed in that they don't help with slipping! I was working at starbucks and found myself slipping all over the place! They're very comfortable and stylish but its irritating they aren't skid resistant as stated.
Wore them twice and it looks like they are not gonna last. The sides are seperating
Shoes fit great except they are wide by the toes. But I bought these for work since I work in a restaurant and have to have non slip shoes. I love the way these look but I took one step in the back kitchen and nearly slipped on my ass I do NOT recommend these at all they are not at all non slip.
This is my second pair. I have worn them on many vacations to cities. They are perfect for walking and since they are rubber there is no problem if it rains.
These shoes came with some weird flying bug eggs that kept hatching out of the shoes and into my house.  I kept taking them outside and whacking them out and then there would be more later that day and the next day.  The heat from my daughters feet made them hatch.  It was really gross.  I finally had to spray them, which I am sure was not good for wearing the shoe. God only knows what they were and where they came from.
They look OK but they are too small. When ordering it said they were women's shoes but the order should be placed in Men's sizes so we did and they are too small. They need to be returned.
I'm a waitress so I was required to buy slip resistant shoes. Its hard to find cute slip resistant shoes but these aren't to bad. They run a little big and aren't them most comfortable but their not bad.
They fit. The first time I wore this for a four hour kitchen shift they became so full of food they were no longer slip resistant. I go threw a new pair of slip resistant shoes every three months and k have never had this happen before.
The size was small and it is very hard that it ripped my skin off multiple times although it is supposed to be a shoes for work.. Design is great but comfortability did now follow..
Fits perfectly, comfortable and non slip sole, never get sore feet considering I'm on my feet 12 hours a day. Excellent for Supermarket work and my last pair has lasted 2 years and still has some life in then. Best shoes I've ever own. Well worth the price and quality.
I was a little skeptical with all the reviews about these shoes running a little big but I'm glad I didn't order smaller ones or they wouldn't have fit. They're a little wide but fashionable and great for a long day of working on my feet
I thought these were a bit pricey because I thought these were man made materials. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that these are leather. I love my shoes. I have a small wide foot. I'm a 5 1/2 and these fit perfectly. Also, the no-slip works perfectly. I'm happy with my purchase.
Good I will buy it again
I had purchased these shoes on may 1st and received them today which was very fast delivery so I'm one satisfied happy camper, they fit me as well so I'm glad for that and they are exactly the same as in the picture. Thanks a lot for the great service! âœ”â˜º
They were too sloppy.
all good
They are still a little slippery, but they are comfy and cuse for work.
Bought these for my sister in law and she loved them. She will even wear them when she's not working because they are that comfortable. Cute non slip shoes, not many options.
In the few weeks they've been worn by my daughter at work she has been more comfortable. They were purchase for more stability after my daughter has had a few bad sprains & can turn her ankle easily. These are wider soles than she had been wearing. FYI our family like Sketchers, we have learned they can run big. We ordered up by a 1/2 size they fit well.
Great shoe
Happy Customer!
These shoes fit fine  but they cause blistering and hurt my feet badly. I have to have nonslip shoes for work and left my 6 hour shift almost crying at how painful it was for me. Also these shoes may say they are nonslip but I was sliding all over the floor. This was a terrible waste of money for me.
This work shoes are not slip resistant...
They are too big. They are not sized properly. Can I send them back after I have worn them to work? The quality is great. It's just the size issue.
This shoe is not very slip resistant. My last pair let me power walk over the wet floor at my work. This pair is only slightly better than regular shoes. They also aren't very comfortable. They feel small in some parts of my foot and too large in others. This makes it difficult for me to feel comfortable in them at all.
Worst work shoes ever! Don't waste your money!!!
Great for work, not your typical looking non slip shoes.  The anti slip works very well.
They are heavy
Fast shipping. Product is as advertised
They fit too big
Love it ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š perfect for work
They are great for when I work. And are very slip resistant. I love them
ok
I've had these for just over a year, and I work arena security.  That means about 9 miles walked in one day on average.  While I can't report zero pain, these shoes are the most comfortable that I own.  I am buying another pair.  Considering how much I wear these shoes, 1 good year is more than enough for the price I paid!
Ordered these shoes for work. The fit is great and feels like I don't have on any shoes at all. Absolutely love them. I just may buy an extra pair.
The shoes were worn approximately three times and the sole began separating. Plus, everywhere she walked the shoes squeaked. My wife threw them out.
The insoles need to be replaced in them. They are not memory foam. They are also very hard to walk on. I sometimes take them off at work to give my feet a bit of a break.
Absolutely love these. They aren't the best looking shoes but I am on my feet all day and no pain.
better than I thoght, very light!
Very good
so comfortable and so light.
I had these shoes less than one week and the sole started to fall off. I bought them for restaurant work and was terribly dissappointed to have to super glue my shoes so quickly
For as much walking as I do they are good.  I'm on my feet off and on about 8-10 hours, but there are other Sketchers that have the comfort of more cushion than these but these are good for a work shoe.
Water went inside my shoe already.
Love them!
These shoes are great but do not hold up as a work shoe should. I bought these for my daughter 2 months ago. She works in the Deli at our local grocery store and they are already falling apart. The outer lower part is detaching from the shoe and sole and allowing water to get in.
Removed thin memory foam inserts, literally no support, replaced with inserts from podiatrist.  otherwise good so far, will see how shoes hold up with all day use 5 days a week.
These are a perfect fit when I put socks on.  They are so very comfortable and easy to put on.  Their not ugly either like some other work shoes I looked at but I do wish they had a little color. maybe pink or blue. They are non slip so that's a plus. I haven't had them very long but so far I love them and the hold up well.  They don't really need any breaking in either.  Yeah if your looking for high quality work shoes these are it!
Is there any way to return it for a smaller size ?????
Expected way more out of a Skechers product. Fit was a little big, which is a drawback of shopping online. However, the product quality was trash. I wear these in an office environment, not really &#34;rough&#34; useage, and the soles fell apart within a month.  Will definitely not order these again.
These shoes are very comfortable,  and the memory foam shapes to the figure of your feet, it's awesome.
LI've these shoes. Comfortable from the minute I put them on. Feel awesome. I highly recommend  for anyone that is on their feet a lot at work.
It looks diferent in the picture ... But no complain
Comfy and light, I love wearing them for work!
Horrible shoe if you walk all day at work. Very uncomfortable. Had them for three months and still have to put bandaids on my ankles to avoid blisters. Even with socks. Not a good shoe for any amount of walking. Hate them.
Nice style. I wear orthotics so I had to put them in the shoe. They fit. There are a little bit rigid and a little wider than I thought, but I will continue to wear them.
These were very tight when I just got, but a week later leather got soft so now I am very comfortable to wear. :) I love them!
I have narrow feet so they are a bit wide for me but I'm used to that.  They are really GREAT! I needed them for a 12 hour day on my feet and wore them the first time with my fingers crossed! They did not disappoint.  I really like them a lot and they saved my feet. Sure, my tootsies were very tired at the end of the day but I think these are really awesome shoes.  I recommend them and they look cool too!
Nice shoes.  Definitely not as light as some other work Skechers, but this style tends to always be on the heavier side.  I work 14 hours day at a restaurant and no complaints yet after a month.  The inside is pretty soft, and the nonslip sole definitely works.  My only complaint is that if you have narrow feet, they will fit big the sizing seems to be a bit weird.  I wear a size 8 in all shoes and ordered such but they were huge so gave them to another girl who wears size 8 wide and they fit her well.  I ordered a size 7 right after and yep, these fit perfectly.  So just beware that you might need to return before getting the right size.
Very comfortable. Love it!
Well, I absolutely loved the style of this shoe. Only problem for me was it was just a bit too snug & tight to get my foot in & the front looked too long. :(<br />Maybe some modifications would help
Very comfortable shoes
These were not what I expected actually!  I thought they were leather, my fault for not reading description.  But I also didn't expect the durable construction of these sneakers either.  I like them because of this, as well as, the ease of a slip-on sneaker.  It feels like a nice running shoe. If your looking for a dainty slip-on sneaker to wear with dressy dresses, skirts, shorts & carpri's these won't be the right sneaker.  However, if your looking for a sneaker that is more durably constructed & is a solid sneaker that you wear with jeans, khakis, causal shorts or active ware than these will work great!
Really bulky
She loves the shoe but it was about a 1/5 size too small.  Will order again, just in next size up!
They're really comfortable, which is hard to find when you have really flat feet. But I can do 8-9hr shifts in these no problem.
I expected a light shoe and a better fit, but  received neither
Good
Love these work shoes. I bought insoles and the top stretched to fit perfect.
I love these shoes.
Runs small
Outstanding  ,love them., Thanks.
I bought these Skechers Mina Slip-ons to replace a pair of similar Naturalizers. The first thing buyers should know is that these are not leather--they have synthetic uppers and rubber soles. These are really basic slip-ons, nothing special about them. I wouldn't call them cute, rather they are plain and functional. I find that the counter is rather low and perhaps a bit wide thus allowing for slippage. The toebox is just long enough to cover my toes and is very round. The biggest drawback for me is that, unlike the shoes I was replacing, these shoes have very little in the way of arch support. The description says they have foam insoles however the only padding is small square at the heal; the rest of the insole is your typical hard lining.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Size fit as expected<br />Basic, functional styling<br />Soles seem non-slip<br /><br />Cons:<br />Synthetic uppers (costly for a synthetic shoe)<br />Low wide counter<br />Lacking in arch support<br />Not a true &#34;comfort&#34; shoe as they lack cushioning
I use this for work so it stretched out too fast.. It was too big with small thin socks and too tight with thicker socks... Still use but should not lose it durability that fast..
Will be exchanging for a 9 1/2. I always wear a 10 so I was surprised when they did not fit. Can't even walk in them as they slip right off.
As if they were designed for a man's foot: no arch-support, too wide in the heel (which caused bleeding blisters the first time I wore them), and weirdly unbalanced so they caused tremendous ball-of-foot pain, which I've never had in my life. I tried everything to make them work: heel padding, new insoles, arch support stickers...nothing worked. Also, not as cute in person as they appear in the photo. Like orthopedic shoes without the comfort.
I should have returned it but for $20+ I kept it.
The shoes feel comfortable, but they are made big in the width and length.
Fantastic comfortable shoes! Runs large, go 1/2 size down!
I really like the shoe! However, the heel is a bit wide--even with my flat feet.
large and heavy
Shoes are cute and anti-skid but run large and wide for my thin feet.
Returned this item.  Did not like over all.  Really wish they fit because they would have been a great work shoe
These shoes are very comfortable, even in 8+ hour shifts in a restaurant environment. However, they are NOT slip proof. In fact, they're only slip resistant on DRY floors. If I walk through the kitchen in water or oily water, I'll slip so easily. I like them because they're comfortable to stand in for long shifts, but I have to be very careful walking through the kitchen and, for this reason, I have a hard time recommending them. If you don't have to walk through wet areas, then they're great. I wear my SFC shoes if I know I'm going to be running through the prep areas a lot; they're much more slip proof
I think these shoes would have been very comfortable IF they had fit.  There was no option to exchange them, which I probably would have for a smaller size.  My only option was to re order at a much higher price, so I returned them.  Very disappointed.
I probably should have ordered a Wide width or the next size up, but I know they will fit better once they are broken in. I still love them!
Cute shoes for a non slip work shoe.  However size is ask wrong.  Even with thick socks way to big length wise by at least a full size while being very narrow in the toes.  Going down a size would not work either.
only complaint is that shoes are not leather uppers as stated in description but synthetic, otherwise they are great shoes
These shoes are comfortable and look professional enough to wear with skirts or pants.  I need shoes with good support and cannot wear most brands.  I have several pairs of Skechers.  The only complaint I have is that they wear out fairly quickly.  I usually wear MBT's and still have pairs I bought six or seven years ago.  The Skechers  generally last 6 to 12 months.  They are comfortable until they wear out.
I tried these shoes in 2 sizes. I am a 10 1/2 and usually need the large size, sometimes the smaller - it all depends on the shoe(they don't often make 10 1/2s). Both the 10 and 11 were loose in the heel. The toe boxes were short for me. The width of the toe box was ok, it was the length. But the width in the middle of the shoe and to the heel was wider than expected. My heel came out on both sizes when walking on my carpet. I did not wear them for long so not sure about long wear comfort. I can say they seemed to have a nice cushion under the heel area. But overall the fit was odd for my foot. I need a narrower heel area.
nice shoes but too narrow in the heel for me,,they were so comfortable I was sad to return them
I typically wear a 7.5 size and based on others' written recommendations, I ordered a smaller size 7 fit. The overall shoes fit fine in this size, however, the toe area was too narrow for me and I doubt it would've fit better in a bigger size. It was uncomfortable the moment I slipped it on. I tried to walk around to see if my feet would get used to it but it did not. And, unfortunately, I had to send it back. Otherwise, the memory foam was a bit on the good surprise kind and it made me feel tall without having a lot of heels. The style was eh-okay and would fit on any work outfit. Price was unbeatable.
These would have been so comfortable, however they ran big and were too roomy for a sock liner. These might work for normal socks but that was not what I was looking for to wear to work. A great Skechers shoe as normal, but just didn't work out for me.
I am pleased with these shoes!  I have bunions so finding work shoes I can wear all day & walk everywhere is important.  Glad I took the advice of reviewers - I normally am a 7 1/2 but have skinny feet. I ordered a 7 and they are just right, but seem a bit wide, although my feet are narrow. Great price for Skechers, and they are rubber-bottomed & supposed to guard against electrocution, I don't really need that lol! but FYI.  All in all a great buy at $20!
I have ordered these shoes three times in order to get the correct size... I normally wear an 8 but had to get a size 7.5 instead. This is the only bad thing I have to say about ordering shoes on line and about these shoes..
Nice shoes but the back of the heel area or the heel tab is too high that it is uncomfortable for me to take a normal step.  Had to give them away.
I love sketchers
Inconsistent sizing! At least a size too large! Would've liked to keep them
I have mixed reviews.  Please read!  I wear a size 8 1/2, I listened to some of the reviewers who said the shoes run a little big, so I ordered a size 8.  Unfortunately for me they were still too big.  I was going to return them until a friend of mine seen them, who wears a size 9.  To our amazement, even though shoe was labeled size 8, they fit her perfectly. She was amazed at the comfort and loved the simple design.  I have to agree with her, the shoe's soles were extremely comfy.  Of course because the price was so low (to me!!), I was happy to gift them to her.  I also want to add that the shoes seemed a little heavy because the rise is not that high, so it seems like the shoes would annoyingly drop off if you didn't get the right fit.
I have tons of skechers shoes and I always wear US9 and they always have had fit great. But these ones were a bit big, hope an additional insole or a shoe insert will help me out
I work as a waitress and have always struggled with finding a shoe that is comfortable, attractive and affordable all in one. Well here it is! I love the slender styling to this shoe, which you don't find often with a slip-resistant work shoe. I have tried flats and maryjanes for work before and those styles tend to lend no support and leave my feet covered in blisters. Clog and oxford styles tend to be comfortable, but are clunky and not as versatile with different styles of pants in my opinion. This shoe fits true to my size, meets my work requirements, supports my feet through  the day, looks great, and didn't break the bank!!
Absolutely love these shoes.
I used to wear a pair of basic black flats for work, but because of the quality and my work environment, I would need to replace them every 6 months or so. I needed a pair of professional looking non-slip shoes that looks good with slacks and skirts/dresses. I work in a restaurant and am constantly running around both front and back of house where there are a lot of wet surfaces. The grip is excellent in the kitchen and I don't have to worry about tiptoeing around like in my old shoes. The slight wedge of the heel offer support which does wonders for my back. The cushion in the sole of the shoe is pretty comfortable as well. They could be a little more sleek...I feel like the design is just a little clunky, which is why I gave 4 stars. But overall, from a person that is on her feet all day, these are excellent shoes and I would definitely recommend them. I did have to order these in a size smaller than I usually wear, so keep that in mind when ordering!
Too large
Great fit and very comfortable. I wear them with skirts/dresses for days where I need to be a little dressier yet comfortable. I've already had a friend buy them from my recommendation for her own job and she has told me they were great. One thing, I had read reviews saying these shoes ran small so I got a half size up the first time. Well, those were slightly too large. Luckily, my mom needed black flats, and as they were her size, I have given them to her, and bought another pair in my own size and, well, perfect fit! So I'd suggest going with your regular size.
I was too big .It's  like  7.5
Toe is roomy. No steel toe discomfort.  Leather does bleed when you sweat so don't wear your favorite socks.  I haven't worn these in wet weather yet,  I am interested in how they perform.  I am up and down ladders and walking across floor joists and my plantarfacitis does not flare up as with previous brands I have worn.
I had the older version of these work boots. A bit heavy but great for working even in the yard.
Great boots. I use them for a myriad of home repair, construction, outdoor projects and they've held up. I especially like the dark color as they don't show the dirt as much.<br /><br />The steel toe and thick soles are fantastic, and I love the eyelets at the top making them easy to get on and off. I've worn them all day without any discomfort.
Too heavy to work with them.
if it isn't too large and too wide, I really love it. It really comfortable.
I was so excited to finally have work boots. They provide great support and were comfortable at the start. I do have to wear thicker socks (but really just sports socks), compared to my every day socks. They clean easy and have great traction. I normally wear a 9.5-10, and was nervous because others said the size didn't always fit right for them. But they have fitted pretty well.
USED FOR HORSEBACK RIDING.
I purchased these boots for yard work. We live in a very wooded area and for some jobs sneakers just don't cut it. I did not want to spend $80 on boots that I was really only ever going to wear for yard work so when I saw these Sketchers I thought they might be garbage because the price was so low. Well I was shocked at the quality of boot I received.  They are super sturdy, and pretty comfortable. They are kinda clunky (I wouldn't wear them hiking) but that's what I would expect from a work boot. I have done two days of yard work wearing them and couldn't be happier. They don't rub or chafe and they get the job done. What a great value for the price. Very pleased with my purchase. Also this is the first online review I have ever written for a product, I think that says a lot.
Great quality. Heavy, heavy boot. Sized a little large even with thick socks.
As expected
As a work boot these are good quality and heavy, well made boots. They run roomy thru the width and ankle, but I wouldn't say you need to go down a full size, but if you are between sizes like me go for the smaller of the sizes rather then the larger. Expect a breaking in period, the leather is stiff and needs time to break in, so take precautions for the first few wears, like heavy socks and short time spans of wearing until you break them in.<br /> If you require a good work boot to protect your feet, this is a good choice.
good
Nice boots but they are a little big and they sit a little high on the leg. They feel comfortable so far.
Great deal. I reordered 2 pair in a smaller size but they still ran big.
Awesome!!
i like it , it's comfortable but too large.
They look good. Fit nice the only down side is two days after wearing them the inside on the heal started wear really bad.
Great so far, the size was just right.
Love them and came super fast. A+++
They are really sturdy, I think they will last a long time.  I like them. One thing is that at the top of the boot in the back, it pushes on the back of my ankle/calve, and I think the just need to be worn for a couple weeks.
Very comfortable. I bought my normal size and they seem little on the big side, but with insole inserts the fit is perfect.
They are perfect!!
Fits well, comfortable. Quick delivery.
I had to send these boot back since they were too large. I also think that they were a little on the heavy side. I would suggest ordering at least a half-size down.
I work in a metal factory making transmission parts. These stand up to the oil, grease and chips very well! Plus my feet didn't hurt the first day I wore them. There's no need to break them in first!
Uncomfortable. Runs large and Rubs agsinst  the ankles
Great, high quality at a good price, I recommend.
This shoe runs large at least for my feet.
These work boots are STEEL TOED. I personally don't find it comfortable. The fit was fine, just not what I expected based off the description. Fortunately these shoes include free returns. Back to the search boards for some women's work boots.
Fits good and love the style, but the one boot of my had a defect so the steel was popping out on the inside and hurting my toe. Sent back hope to get a replacement soon.
They arent soft at all they are so stiff and hurt  u if u have a wide feet i dont recommend this product at all
Fit perfectly
They were delivered in two days!<br />I ordered my usual size and they fit perfectly, the memory foam is like walking on a cloud. i will definitely be ordering anotger pair!!
Good shoes
very good
it feels like I am not wearing shoes at all with these.  They are comfortable and feather light.
Great shoes
I will buy these shoes for work as long as they are made!  Perfect for a long day on my feet on sometimes slippery concrete floors.
Very nice!!
I bought a size smaller because a different pair of Skechers I bought were too big, but these weren't, so I had to send the first pair back. The second pair fit just fine. I really like these.
Fit great.
Not nonslip.  Worked in a restaurant and couldn't use them because they weren't   really non slip shoes.  Gave an extra star just because they fit and were cute.
Too big
These shoes look pretty cool from the picture, but they show your socks a lot. Also, they say they are non slip but I slip and slide all over my restaurant. Not much support and made very cheaply.
Sizes run BIG!!
They look nice but the numbers run larger than expected
Great working shoes.<br />Very comfortable
Got these shoes for the style. Working long hours I needed something that would fit with me being on my feet 10 hours a day. After only a month, the front ends of the shoes were coming a part. Other than that, I love the shoes. But, they aren't exactly &#34;work&#34; shoes, in my opinion.
Bought these for my daughter who is a server. She has worn them nearly everyday and are just now needing to be replaced. Not bad for shoes worn that much. And nothing is slip-proof! If there is grease on the kitchen floor, you will slip no matter what you are wearing, but these shoes are about as close as it gets to slip-proof. And she says they are comfy and cute, too! They look like Tom's.
Would be good but WAY too big! I'm usually a 6.5-7 so I ordered a 7 because..socks..And tried them on after receiving and they fit like a narrowish 8. Not even fixable with said socks. I was really excited about hitting up my average corporate America workday in these bad boys but sadly, I cannot.
They run a little big, they also fit pretty loose. Not a lot of support and not comfortable all day.
I ordered my shoes on June 5th, today is July 5th (so I've had them less than a month) and the soles are already messed up and separating from the shoe itself.
I've had Skechers work shoes before and didn't have a problem with slipping, but I'm slipping a lot in these. Also flat bottoms. I added some Dr. Scholls and that made them better. They look good and fit true to size but I can't were them to work.
Arrived on time but runs a little big
I bought this shoe for my new job, and I have slipped every single day I've worn them. Not only did I notice they weren't glued properly, but they don't even serve the intended purpose. Another coworker has them and says hers do not prevent slipping either. The only reason I bought the shoes was so I wouldn't slip at work. Do not buy them if you're doing so to keep from slipping.
I really liked the way the shoes looked however they were extremely uncomfortable. As for slip-resistant, these shoes provide no traction on wet floors and sent me flying several times. Don't spend your time or money on these.
I love these shoes for work!!
started to fall apart after a couple months...but I was wearing them for long hours on my feet
I bought these for my daughter, she has tried different work shoes; but decided to go back to these
I have worn these shoes for up to 14 consecutive hours on three different restaurant's floors. They have absolutely no grip. I slip whether or not there is liquid on the ground. I've had them for about 5 months - and haven't been wearing them regularly - and the sole is already starting to peel away from the shoe. The fit and comfort is fine, but these are not slip resistant.
I am a 8.5 wide so I ordered the 9 wide.  I feel the wide feels more like a normal width.  I wanted something light with a flat, soft sole to wear all day as a house keeper in a hotel.  I do not enjoy bulky running shoes or clogs and do not like added arch support in shoes (I am a barefoot runner and hate added arch support that never lines up with my foot- which just adds extra stress on my arch).  I needed something meant for work and non-slip.  These do work.  They are as close to a very basic, minimal shoe I could find and still get away with it in the work place.  I feel the quality of the shoe is not in line with the price.  Within a few days the leather at the toe was scuffed and worn off but in my work place, appearances are not high priority.  Overall, I've been wearing them 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week, for six months and they are still holding up.  (Another thing to note is that the material does not breath well, so they cannot be worn without socks or else you'll end up a sweaty mess).
Very cute and comfortable, I would purchase a half size smaller!
They were cute but too big... I was surprised as this is the size I always wear in this brand.
These may or may not make me slip even more than &#34;regular&#34; shoes. I'm a restaurant manager and these absolutely do not cut it as far as slip resistance goes. While they are very comfortable, the tiniest bit of water has me sliding across the kitchen. I do not recommend these if you plan on working in the back of house area in a restaurant.
Pretty good just too large.
My mom loves these!!! I bought them for her after she saw them on her physical therapist, and they're just as comfortable as she thought they would be. My mom has wide feet and was able to wear her usual size 9. No wide size needed, since this shoe seems to be suited for wide feet.
I love the look and feel of these shoes and they are extremely comfortable to wear at work. The one downside is that this is the second time I'm having to purchase them within a two month period. I've found them to be less durable than desired, especially when walking for a long time and they began to fall apart within a month. I do like the look and feel however, so I purchased them again.
I love the look of them, but they were too big. I have another pair of Skechers non slip work shoes that are 7.5 so I figured they'd fit perfectly. I'm returning them and getting a size smaller!
I like the style and fit. Unfortunately both pairs of Sketchers non slip work shoes I have bought last about 3-4 months before the non slip part of the sole becomes detached. I love the shoes very comfortable with great style.  Unfortunately they just aren't built to last. I got this pair to last 6 months by gluing the soles back on.
The fit feels fine with socks on. Definitely a little slippery working behind the bar but hopefully will get better with a little wear. I love how my feet aren't soaking wet by the end of the night because no water can get through the top :)
Disappointed
Cute shoes, but not even close to being slip resistant. I may just be used to my fabulous Dansko Clogs, but these are not slip resistant. It is easy to slide if you take a corner too quickly in the kitchen, which is disappointing!
EDIT: I gave these a good review at first but I had not taken them to work yet. They're comfortable, yes, but they are absolutely not slip proof. They do just as bad as regular shoes on a slippery wet restaurant floor. I constantly have to tip toe through wet surfaces for fear of losing my balance completely.<br /><br />Previous: So far so good. They are very similar to Toms in the way they fit and feel. They don't have any arch support so if you're on your feet all night/day at a restaurant you might want to get a set of inserts. I normally wear an 8.5 but the first pair I ordered were too large for me. I went a half size down to 8 and it was a great fit. I'm sure if you are going to put in inserts your normal size should be just fine.
Very uncomfortable! If you work in a restaurant,  save your money and get a good pair of shoes!
Horriable traction on wet floors. I expected a lot more for the money. Wore for one busy shift as a bartender and slid all over the place.
Headline says it all.
Fits as expected. Comfortable nice item.  Thank you  PLEASED
Quality was good. Arrived on time but they wlopped off the heal of my foot. I would not say the were too long just too wide in the heal.
The most comfortable work shoe I have ever worn. I would suggest these to anyone, especially servers, that need to be on their feet all day. I love these!!!
Am on feet all day Really helped keep feet for being on concrete all day long
I don't know if they work, but they feel great.
My only problem with them is that the surface finish of the shoes has started to peel off.
I do not recommend these shoes or the Galaxy Sports company. Galaxy Sports is located in England which explains the ridiculous shipping time/fees. They are slow to respond to customer complaints and then have simply ignored my email for weeks.<br />I'm a RN and constantly on the lookout for a comfortable work shoe. These Skechers were pretty comfortable when I tried them on at home, but after working a shift my feet were numb and tingly and the shoe was cutting into my ankles. This is the first time I've had trouble with Skechers so I'm only dissatisfied with this shoe and the poor customer service at Galaxy Sports.
Great fit!  Love them!!
They are perfect for nurses who stay at their feet all day. No more back pain since i have been using them by 4 years ago. It sad that they dont sell them anymore at skechers stores or online store.There is no better shoe for me.
Love the shoes very comfortable for my job on my feet all day and walking to work. Don't want to take off when I get home
I had to settle, since shape ups have obviously been discontinued I cannot find what fits me best in my size.
its the only kind of shoes i will wear for work coz its comfortable
I work in retail and need shoes to blend with my dressy/casual clothing.  These look like regular loafers and they feel like sneakers.  Not the most stylish shoes, but my arthritic feet can walk in them for a 9 hour workday and still feel pretty good when I get home.  They take some getting used to at first because they have rounded soles and feel strange until you get used to them.  I have several pairs of Sketchers with this type of sole and love them all.
Not the prettiest shoe in the world, but it does what it was made for. I'd buy it again
Should have taken tie to break them in. Wore straight to work, by end of second day feet were cramping. Otherwise, shoes are fine.
I love these shoes! Most comfortable work shoes I have ever worn.  My feet don't hurt,  my back doesn't hurt like it normally would from liftday people  and walking all day. Took a few days to break in but I love these shoes.  I will be buying another pair.
I love this style, others do too, but they don't want to order online.
Bought these for my wife and she cannot say enough good things about them, she is on her feet all day long at work and feels she would not make it all day feel as good as she does without these shoes. Highly recommended
I am one of those who love the sketchers Shape Up shoes.  Not because they supposedly tone legs and butts but because they have proven very beneficial to me.  I had a lot of trouble with my back and my feet, now I don't.  I also know several other people with similar problems that these shoes helped.<br /><br />Like with any product,  if you try it and it starts to make things worse, maybe it isn't for you like it is for me.
Love my shape ups, always have and always will
This is my second pair.  I wear them constantly.  I've always had foot problems, very bad pain if I'm on my feet to long. With my skechers, I don't have that problem.  I LOVE THEM!!!!!!!
They are so comfortable, i can wear them all day without any problems,very ,very ,happy!!!!
I am a nurse pounding the ward all day. These are best shoes I have worn. No more aching legs and sore feet.
The wife loves them
Nice
I've worn these shoes for a long time and glad to find them again here on Amazon.  When I am working these are great when being on the feet all day.  This model also conforms to service industry standard 'black shoe' mandatory requirements.
I love them...
A great pair of shoes. Definitely worth it.
great for standing on feet all day cutting hair
Great shoe this is my second pair. I am on my feet all day and my feet do not hurt at all.
I love Love Love this shoe.  I was so sad when I couldn't find shape ups anymore.  I walk at least 4 miles a day at my job, I'm in my 50&#34;s, and the shape ups had helped so much.  when my old pair wore out, I tried over 20 different shoes, and I was in so much pain in my feet, legs and back.  then Sketchers brought these back.  Within a day, I felt great!!!!  Thank you Sketchers for bringing the shape ups back!!!!  **and to the comments that said they are too high, once you start walking in them, you don't notice it at all.
I really like skechers shape-ups model, but this model is too high bottom of a shose compared with other design. It is like a high heel;; i do not try yet.. But i think it is not that comportable than other models. And even it is bigger than other design. I want to return it but i live in Australia... I do not have a choice. Before to buy it, you have to try it for fitting you.
The shoes its okay but too high
They run small
Bought these shoes for my wife. She always liked the Sketcher Shape-ups. When you are on your feet for 10 plus hours a day, you want a comfortable shoe. These are great.
Great product fits wonderfully and does what is says it should, tones butt and legs. You need to keep balance and stand up straight to avoid back problems.
bought for my mother theses are the only shoes she will wear!!! she swears by them not for working out but the comfort of them!
Actually, the fit is better than I'd expected since I tend to have narrow feet. The size feels accurate. They ARE made in China, of course.  I have a lot of problems with my feet due to previous accidents, etc., and I wear this style of shoe to help with arch support and plantar fasciitis.  They have allowed me to walk without pain!!  This is not the first pair of this style of Skechers I have worn. I also have other brands which I like, but Skechers are more flexible for everyday and are good for what ails me!!
Good shoe. Just a seller described.
I don't wear anything but these shoes! I have feet that hurt within an hour or two if I wear a shoe with no cush. I call these my marshmallow shoes because the sole is so soft you can push your finger into it. These have been the best shoe I've found in many years that are so comfortable even after 10 hour shifts. I don't just wear them to work either. The &#34;work&#34; model is also much lighter than the regular model that looks just like them.
Usually I'm very satisfied with my orders. But this time I ordered a pair of Sketchers shoes<br /> I received my order the size on the box was right the shoes inside were not. Thought ok honest mistake.  Returned them and ordered another pair. Received them have the same problem.  NOT A HAPPY COSTUMER.
LOVE IT
All day long and kept feet comfortable.  Concrete floors are the worse to wear your feet out
Wife has foot problems and this is all she will ware
The best shoes to be walking all day long!!!!
I have had back surgery before so I deal a lot with lower back pain, & work all day on my feet (8+ straight hours, no sitting!), and these shoes are amazing!!! Far superior to other expensive sneakers or shoes I have bought, and believe me, I've tried EVERYTHING!!! They look super cute, and give me some height, I love them!
Great shoes. Stand. Sll day<br /> Feet. Not hurting
3rd pair. I use them for work.
I really love these for work!!!  I'm an RN in a Burn unit & help out on surgery. I was so disappointed that Skeckers stopped this line of shoes. They are so comfortable I wear them everywhere
I have yet to purchase this but I did buy the regular skechers shape up sneakers a few years back and wanted to break down a review for that. I physically bought mine in an outlet store and it was the best $110 I ever spent. I have the type of feet that no matter what you slid them into, my feet would ache after an hour out. Until Sketchers Shape ups...... They were a dream come true for a weary, hesitant customer service employee. I tried several other sketchers work shoe but they all still killed my feet. Fortunately though, these make walking on clouds a real thing. I'm the type of person who fidgets when idle too long so being able to rock back and forth was also a big plus. I gave my 5 stars based on buying this product years ago and knowing it worked well. I will be buying these shoes sometime this month so I can go back to my loyal skechers love. Also, just to to inform, I bought the shoes when I was 5 months pregnant in 2010. The shoes lasted three years and was in perfect condition all the way through. I expect no less from the next pair I buy.
My wife likes these shoes for walking in.  She likes them in the summer to go shopping or garage selling and on days when she knows that she will be on her feet all day.  . They are black and they really look nice. She has been wearing Sketchers Shape-ups for several years now and she really like them. They are extremely comfortable as they feature a lot of cushion in the sole that reduces joint damage.  These shoes just help reduce the impact from daily walking.<br /><br />In addition the shoes feature a non-slip sole and they do help you increase your muscle tone and balance. They take some getting used to as the soles are not flat like traditional shoes. The curved surface of the sole and the thick cushioning make you constantly adjust your balance. You do it sub consciously and as a result you are using your core muscles, hip muscles and leg muscles while doing this. After a few weeks you will suddenly realize the difference. She says it feels like you are walking on a piece of thick foam padding.<br /><br />These shoes are very comfortable and rugged. She loves Sketchers Shape-up shoes and that is why she keeps buying them!
A little smaller than my pair I purchased in the store a year ago<br />Otherwise excellent experience
Loved these while standing on my feet 8-10 hours a day
I wear these shoes EVERY DAY, all day, I do a LOT of walking and they last me about 3 years! The arch is the key things for me as it falls in the perfect place for my foot, something that is not true for almost all other shoes I've ever worn, something to watch for. I'm in love with the Skechers fit and resulting comfort.
Love these shoes. Been looking for these around town for a long time since my previous shape-ups wore out. Finally bit the bullet and ordered online + I'm so glad I did. The size is perfect and they arrived quickly.
I work on my feet all day so this is perfect for meðŸ‘ðŸ‘
The shoes are very comfortable and the sole is no-slip, but one seam broke on the side of a shoe a month after the purchase.  I was able to have the shoesfixed at a local cobbler, but needless to say I am not impressed with the quality.
the are wonderful I'm going to buy every color and i walk all day in them i hate to take them off
Comfortable has great support great for work
for now they do feel good on my feet.
These are the best shoes for work. I'm on my feet 12 1/2 hrs at work and my heels would hurt.  I just bought another pair because no other shoe compares.... I've owned about 6 of these!!! Best & you can go anywhere!! Pain Free!!!
LOVE IT
Good shipper,great support, wear and fit. Good anti- slip. Will buy again and recommend to friends and coworkers
Good work shoes, on my feet all day, my feet are happy when they are in these shoes!
These do run very large & wide; I actually had to size down one whole size and they are still a little wide.  They are very comfortable though and the support is really good too!
These shoes are super comfortable. Do order one size smaller as they run a little large.
These shoes are not made to fit snug. I ordered my normal size and they fit as expected.
Wonderfully comfortable great arch support ,though order down a half size !<br />Love these shoes... lightweight, foot savers!!
These shoes are incredibly comfortable. I was having heel pain/planter fasciitis I tried several different shoes before these. Since wearing Skechers work clogs  (40+ hours a week)  I have not had any problems. When I 1st started wearing them I felt like I was walking on a trampoline, they are wonderful. HOWEVER they run large I ended up with a shoe an entire size smaller and they keep getting larger. They are a clog so they are not fitted in the heel however the entire shoe is stretching to the point I can not keep my foot in them with out effort. I have 2 co-workers ( between the 3 of us we have sizes (7, 7.5 and 8) who purchased the same shoe and they have the same experience. I have had mine now for 4 months, I am on my feet  at least 6 hours a day walking, lifting and some standing, they are still in good condition, very comfortable. I will purchase another pair but will go even smaller next time.  One other note is the 1st few days of wearing the shoes there does seem to be calf soreness but it goes away after you adjust to the shoe (maybe its due to heel height).
In shoes I alternate between size 9 and 9 1/2.  Unfortunately  I ordered a 9 1/2 in these and they're way too big.  I have a pair of Danskos so I know the heel is supposed to be loose.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm going to have to return these and reorder them in either an 8 1/2 or a 9.  These shoes are cut wide, which I would like in the correct size.  And they have nice toe room. These are lighter than Danskos and the soles are rubber so they provide a nice shock absorber for your feet. After I ordered mine I noticed a fitting guide that helps you decide what size to order. I wish I had seen that before I ordered mine =(.  Anyway,  I'm anxious to try them in my correct size.
I don't like it
Returned them..not as comfortable as I thought they would be.
Fit way too big
They are not a comfy as I was hoping for.  All my other Sketchers are great.
Nice shoe, I guess, but was way too large.  Ordered normal size but had 1/2&#34; extra room at back of heel.  Have to return :(
These made my back hurt really bad.  Not recommended for long periods of time.
It has decent support, but stand too still for a long period of time and it starts to hurt. The shoe was VERY BIG, not just a little loose. I normally wear a 5.5 and I ordered a 5 and there was still a good inch of space.
looked good but were way too large
while this pair was too big and each pair runs very large, I did return these and get a pair at the local store that fit right.  they still did strech out and are bigger again, and a bit narrow for my wide feet.  However they are good for working in. they are taller than most work shoes too. When you first put your feet in these you will be amazed at how squishy and great feeling these are. They are very comfy for sure.  I was worried about them being too tall to work in, but I have not had any issues with them.
They are on the larger size needed a size down just gave away  didn't have time to return
I sent these back once. I wear an  8 1/2 so I exchanged for an 8 and they are still too big. I didn't want the hassle of sending them back. I would probably say &#34;I love them&#34;  if I had a 7 1/2 but don't really know.
Love these shoes. I work in a bakery full of flour and frosting and am so glad they wipe off so easily. They're comfortable and have already lasted me longer that many other shoes I have bought for work. They have just enough grip on the bottom to keep from sliding and I am so glad to find this style of shoe with a back on it so they don't slide off of my feet. I will definitely buy these again in the future.
i was told to buy them in the same size tennis shoe I wear, well it was way too big! And not knowing that there was a 30 day return policy I am now stuck with them!
These are comparable to the Cherokee nurse clogs in comfort and design. They cost less when on sale, and they are on sale more often than other brand clogs.<br /><br />I still like the Cherokee's more (because of the suede-matte finish), but these are a great stand-in when the Cherokee's aren't available for order.<br /><br />We have to order these every few months and they are worn every day for at least 16 hours, with at least 10 of those hours standing/walking around.<br /><br />The clog design is easy to clean and they fit snugly. They add height and have a nice heel while still giving arch support.
I was tired of spending 175.00 on work shoes I read the reviews on these and I thought gonna go for it i went by what reviews sais as far as size I just wish I would have gone smaller I work 60 hours a week and these shoes aren't cutting it my feet hurt so bad after my shift and ankles hurt during shift they are so wide that I struggle during the day to keep them on I quests I going back to spending much more but at least I know my fit wont hurt.........
This shoe is extremely large you should not buy your actual size
Run large, but very comfy!
Worst shoe ever. Killed my feet. RIP.
These shoes are comfortable.  They are rubber soles which absorb shock if on your feet all day.  I am an RN and see some wearing int he toes on top from locking and unlocking carts all day to move patients.  The do run wide so if you have a very narrow foot, they are not for you.  I just ordered second pair. They are more comfortable than Dansko clogs for sure.
Normally wear an 8, went to a 7. Very comfortable but not holding up very well after a few weeks.
Love the support of these shoes. I had a pair of sketchers clogs for a long time. Finally broke down and bought a new pair. I ordered the same size but I find these fit loser than my original pair.
Wrong size.
These shoes are very light and comfortable. These shoes are definitely a departure from my Dansko shoes. I've been wearing them for a week now and so far my feet have not gotten tired after working 12 hour shift. I've been trying to recommend these to my coworkers and so far I'm pretty satisfied with it.
I work in a medical office and these shoes are like walking on a cloud!  I am a size 9 in every shoe I have ever tried on except for these.  They do run large/wide so make sure you order a half size smaller than what you normally would.  I have had them for a couple months now and my feet feel great at the end of the day.  They are very squeaky on hard floors, so keep that in mind - it is annoying.  Fortunately we have mostly carpet at my workplace.  The sole is very thick so it does add about 1-1 1/2 inches to your height.  They seem to scuff easily as well.  Overall best shoe for work I have had!
I think that the design is wide but the look very comfortable to be used the whole day.
This shoes are very nice, but they run quite large. I bought my normal size, and had to return it for a whole size smaller.
My friend loves everything about this shoe. She is a nurse and is on her feet all day long
I ordered the exact size I wear for my work shoes. They are too big. I wear two sometimes three pairs of socks because I work on concrete floors. They are very comfortable.
Very comfortable shoes!  They do make you taller with the thick sole.  I am a size 11 but ordered in size 10 and they fit perfect with thin socks on.
Great shoes, but overpriced.  Selling same for 1/2 price at Shoe Carnival.
Love, love, love them! The price is right, the look is right, the feel is right.
I'm on my feet 12 hours ,three days in a row. I have been trying to find a shoe that wouldn't hurt my feet. I can wear these shoes only one day then have to wear another pair.
They run a size bigger
I don't like these shoes at all. They are OK. I've worn these shoes for almost two months and they have done nothing but hurt my legs. By the 4-5 hour mark I have to take them off or sit down. I am on my feet all day and I read that these shoes were supposed to be good for my type of work, but I beg to differ. The shoe isn't quite right either. It makes your feet slide forward in the shoe, shifting your weight on to the balls of your feet and then you compensate will the heel, and eventually your whole feet start to hurt and then it moves up your legs. By the end of my shift my hips are hurting and I can barely move once I get home. I will not be buying or wearing these shoes again. They'll be given away or trashed.
Gave them away
I ordered true to size.  They are as described the back is not a snug fit, even with fitness type socks.
These shoes are VERY comfortable... I am a bartender on my feet all day... order a full size down as they do run large...
Very comfortable, originally purchasers because they are slip resistant, they are excelling and serving their purpose. My only complaint is the size. I normally wear a 9.5, other reviews stated that they ran large. I ordered a 9, they are still slightly to big.
I really wanted these shoes to work. I was aware, based on the other reviews, that they would probably be a bit big. However, I was unable to order a smaller size, as the smallest available was a size 7. I decided to try it because &#34;maybe the other reviewers were wrong.&#34; Well, no. They weren't. These shoes fit me at least a size, maybe a size & a half too big. Because these are the cheapest shoes I could find which fit the requirements for my nursing school clinicals, if amazon were selling them in a size smaller, I would definitely re-order them in a smaller size. Other than horrible sizing issues, the shoes felt very comfortable. I didn't get the impression that they would last for a long time, but they would work for a cheap, comfortable clinical shoe.<br /><br />Pros:<br />comfortable, cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />MASSIVE (and can't get size I need), likely short lifespan
Had to return the first pair, order a size smaller or two.
Wish there were more colors to choose from! Bought these for clinicals and wore them during my 12 hour shift to test them out. LOVE THESE SHOES!
I love these shoes for work as well as everyday wear !
Scuff marks already so not happy about that. They are comfortable, but very loose fitting. Good enough for the price.
Light, but very uncomfortable after 15 minutes of wearing them. Gave them away. I go back to my Dansko shoes.
feels like walking on marshmallow, a little difficult, but I like them. Would order again.
I ordered these shoes for my job in an orthopedic office. They are very comfortable, but they do run large. I normally wear a 9 but ordered an 8 and they fit perfect! still big enough to easily slide my foot in and out. I have had them for 2 months now and they have stretched out a bit in the width. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars, is because they seem to scuff very easily. Not a huge worry for me, but I thought I would make a note of it.
They run really big!
I love my sketchers. But I'm not a fan if the clogg style. I get it how they are supposed to fit. But I don't care for the slip off my heal every step I take. But they are super comfy. Like walking on a cloud. Outlast me and my 10 hour bar/serving shifts. And believe me when I tell you- I hustle.... Anyway. Will be going back to my lace ups. :)
Super comfortable, professional looking,  I would have paid double for them!
HURT my feet!  I'm a nurse, and do a lot of standing and walking.  I ordered 1/2 size larger after reading previous reviews and should have ordered my exact size instead.  These shoes are too big, even after adding Dr. Scholls gel inserts.  I tried to return them, but missed the return window by 2 days. I can not wear them for more than about 30 minutes before the top of my foot gets sore - Will not be buying them again.
These shoes are hot and uncomfortable.
Love the shoe but fits a whole size larger
They are not as comfortable as they look!
A size too big.
Very comfortable shoe. Feels like I'm walking on clouds and there's not as much tention in my lower back after standing in these for 8+ hrs. I did order half a size smaller and they are a perfect fit.
I like it...I'm a 9.5 and this was a little  big.
Great product
SO squishy! I was very pleasantly surprised by these shoes - they are wonderful - however I ordered a full size smaller than I usually wear after reading the reviews - glad I did, my true size would have fallen off my feet.  Awesome shoes.
I work in a pharmacy & am on my feet 10 hours at a time and these shoes are super comfortable  to wear all day. I cannot wear them walking around outside of work though since they are a little large-they didn't come in 1/2 sizes so had to go larger. I can live with this since my feet feel so much better in these shoes after a long day. Great cushioning, breathable, highly recommend them for anyone on their feet for long periods of time.
Fits like a 10 1/2 know one fits this. I need 8 like I ordered now I'm stuck with it.
I read the reviews that stated that these shoes run large. I bought one full size smaller than I usually would and the fit is perfect! My feet are slightly wide and the shoes are super comfy, not tight at all, not too loose. Love them and wish they would come in more colors.
These clogs are absolutely amazing.  As soon as I put my foot in and stood up, it was like standing on clouds. I ordered the Women's 7 and they fit exactly as a clog should, with a slight gap at the back of the heel. I wore this on a 6k walk around the city last Sunday and was perfectly happy and comfortable the entire time.  I'm going to check to see if they come in fun colors. I wouldn't mind owning several pair of these.
Very comfortable.  Great for my profession.
Comfortable shoes. But the sizes run big
Very comfortable for 12 hour shifts
These shoes were very large, probably one full size too big. Some reviewers say they are not large and they should be loose and fit like a clog. I disagree, they run very large even for a clog. I could not wear them. However, they did feel like they would be very comfortable in the right size. Cannot comment on arch support because I never got to wear them. I tried to exchange for a smaller size, but none were available from Amazon fulfillment, only from another source and the price was three times what I paid for them.
These shoes are the best!!!
I would recommend buying a half size down! Ordered a size 8 and they were literally slipping off my feet, had to put extra soles to make them fit better.  Other than that, they are very comfy.
They are very comfy, slightly loose, but that's the way they should be. Not too pretty-looking though, but the comfort does make up for that.
I had to purchase all white nursing shoes for clinical, I honestly would prefer a pair of Nike sneakers, but there aren't that bad. They're not comfortable enough for me, after 3 hours I'm over wearing them.
Way too big, will be returning. Otherwise, they seem as though they would be comfortable and are very shiny!
Got here quick.. Wish I saw how large they ran before ordering.. Over all a good shoe though.
Larger than expected. Not much side support, I have found that I roll my ankles die to lack of support and such high heels.
These shoes are very comfortable as far as the arch support. But they do run big. I should have gotten a size smaller than what I normally wear. But I can still wear them to work and be comfortable all day. If I order again I will order smaller.
These shoes run three sizes to big and are also very wide! Disappointed,  this is the first time this brand has let me down. I went into an actual sketchers store and tried in the smallest pair available and still too big!! What?? I have worn this brand for 15 yrs...
Really soft and comfy when I tried them on. They were just too wide for me :(
I love these shoes! I am on my feet all day and these really keep them from hurting. They went right on and needed no breaking in. And, they look great. The only - slight - drawback is that the bottom is soft (even though it does mold to your foot and give good arch support) and when you have to do hard walking, like up and down stairs and long distances, the bottom tends to give way too much and your feet get tired. Overall, a great shoe and I will them again. I'm glad I read the reviews and expected them to be a little loose, like a clog should be. They are not a form-fitting regular shoe - they are clogs. I love them!
I haven't tried to wear these shoes more than an hour. I bought them for when I wear my suits.
Not happy, shoes 2 months old now look 6 years old. No reason they should be like this working in Veterinary field.
I love the feel of these shoes, and love the way they look.<br />They are soft and light.<br /><br />Only thing I don't care for, is the noise they make as I walk. It makes same sounds as they make when you are wearing shoes too big for you.<br /> Other than that, these are just great pair of shoes.
I love the fit and comfort of these shoes
Kinda disappointing because they were a really good buy at $25.00 but I have to return them and won't pay $90 for them so I won't know what they actually feel like.
Very comfortable all day long
I usually buy Dansko clogs for work but I couldn't pass up on the price so overall pretty great! I just wear thicker socks, problem solved.
These run very large!  They felt about 1 size to big!  Bummer...  They were slightly squeeky out of the box, otherwise a nice shoe! Memory foam feels very nice on tired feet.
Just alittle to big but very comfortable
Ran apox. 1/2 a size larger then my regular shoe size; however by placing a couple of inexpensive cushion insoles inside EACH shoe, it's become a much more comfortable and truer fitting shoe. Definitely would purchase once again!
Great work shoes!
These shoes were returned because they were on the large side, at least by one 1/2.size.  Otherwise, they are as advertised in photos, attractive, well made, with good support.
It's like walking on pillows. They do fit loosely so it takes like a week to get used to wearing them without worrying they're gonna fall off but now I really like them. It's made me realize how uncomfortable all my other shoes were. I usually wear a 9 and got them in 8.5. Usually I just wear them to work so mostly sitting with intermittent walking but I went on a day trip and walked in them all day, had no problems. Can wear them to work or casual. Kind of like rubbery Berkinstocks (I've never worn Berkinstocks so what I mean is that they LOOK like Berkinstocks). Worth it.
had to return them because they did not fit
They are a bit large but very comfortable
I'm an 8 in women's and did my research and chose these for my clinical classes. I just received them today and they are TOO BIG. I don't have time to return them, so I'm going to have to just deal with it by wearing thicker socks. Only time will tell if they're comfortable. Hopefully I'll remember to update this review once I wear them and break them in
These shoes are great! I bought these because I work 12 hour shifts and spend all of that time on my feet. I'd heard that this style of clog is very comfortable and wanted to try them out. Being a nursing student, I cannot afford Danskos or some of the other popular brands. So, I was elated when I saw these for $24! I've been wearing them for a couple of weeks now and they are fantastic! I can wear them through my shift and during the rest of the day if I need to.
Great working shoes
very comfortable
Not very comfortable
Great and on time!
This shoes is AMAZING!!!! I recommend this shoe to anyone even Men lol. So comfortable like you're walking on clouds.
I went to try on a pair of Danskos and was told (by so many of my coworkers) that they were the best shoes to get. I felt they were too hard on my feet and I like soft supportive shoe. I couldn't afford to buy the Danskos anyway because of so many expenses for the start of nursing school. I saw these in black one day while shopping around for the required all white shoe... in store they didn't carry white, but, amazon, I love you! I found them here. These are amazing, like walking on a cloud amazing. I like them the way they are, but they do come with a removable insert, so you can pop your orthotics in. Since I have &#34;duck feet&#34;, the width is perfect and roomy in the toe box.
I love the shoes and it fit perfect!!!
Very comfy shoes i love them
This shoe is HORRIBLE!!  Unfortunately I listened to the reviews which raved about the comfort. NOT TRUE! They are way too big, I returned for 1/2 size smaller and are still big. They seem comfortable when you 1st put them on, but after a hour the balls of my feet ache. There is no support at all! I would have sent back but I wore them twice.  DO NOT PURCHASE!!
Comfortable for walking
Too big and no support at all.  Reviews said they were great and comfortable....no no no! DO NOT BUY!  I would send back but have tried to wear them twice.
When ordering, I would suggest going a full size smaller. I only ordered a half size smaller. They will work ok for now.
I love these shoes! i got a half size smaller and they fit like a clog, a little loose but soooo comfortable. My feet dont hurt at all after 13 hours1
I can wear with thick socks in winter!
The shoes were a little bit larger but feels comfortable wearing two socks.  I like it so far.
I normally wear an 8.5 or 9 in most shoe styles, and these were quite big. And I have wide-ish, flat feet! :)
Excellent
I've been wearing this type of shoe for a while.  Usually Dr. Scholl's, but can't find them anymore so I thought I would try these, since the style is the same.  I have a LOT of trouble with my feet (many surgeries) and find these very comfortable.  Thank you for making them available.
Love the shoes, very comfortable!  I did buy a half size smaller and still a little sloppy (but comfy sloppy).<br />only reason I only gave 4 stars, they are a little tall making it easy to bend ankles!<br /><br />Work in medical field on feet 8+ hours
The shoe is very comfortable only down fall it's made very big I am a 9.5 I ordered a 9 and it was way to big got an 8.5 and it's still big but tolerable
Sent them back
Sizes with me and just about anyone depends on the shoe but with these after you wear them for 8 hours the stretch a lot so if anyone plans on buying these shoes go at least a size smaller than you normally wear or go to a store that carries these exact shoes and try them on and walk around for a while because otherwise you'll be disappointed like I was and now I have a pair of shoes I paid too much for and are way too big that are just collecting dust
Shoes are comfortable , I went up a half size, a little big. They are a great shoe for nurses.
Love them! Will order more. Been wearing them for a couple weeks and they are super comfortable. They are little large but I need that with my bunions. They are soft and not pushing against my bunions like Dansko and they are much more lighter weight. Legs feel better too. Bought the plain black for 38 bucks, the next week they went up in price to 70 bucks. So I bought the white and patent too. Just went to skechers outlet tried the shoe on  and usually wear 8 and 7 1/2 fit better so they do run large!
I love these shoes!  They are comfortable as well as stylish! And they fit true to size..would have gotten 5 stars but I did have quite an issue with the delivery of these shoes. However when I called, amazon handled the issue very promptly as well as professionally
Bought a second pair. I'am a young 70 year old great grandma. Still work in the medical field. On my feet 71/2 hrs. I have all the aches and pains of anyone my age, but these shoes have saved me.  I believe that they have strengthened my legs as well.  Got a pair to wear when I'am out and about. It was a great find for me.
Great shoes, but about a little over a half size too big. Luckily I was able to give them to someone else.
The back of the shoe serves no purpose at all. It is not comfortable for me to walk around in a shoe that my heel keeps slipping in and out of. I regularly wear a size 9 shoe and I got these in an 8. A full shoe size smaller and my heel is still flapping around. They need to either get rid of the back part of the shoe and let it be a clog or make to fit properly. Change the sizing system maybe
I am a nurse and I bought this shoe for work. It fits perfect and is very comfortable. It allows me to stand on my feet all shift long without me complaining. I'd definitely recommend to anyone. Good buy.
They have thin bottom I'm constantly feeling I'm gonna twist my ankle, n the sponge bottom seems to sink, very comfy when not walking in them
Super comfy but very big. Not true size
I am in the medical field and I l be them! They feel great and no slip
Made Feet go numb
They are a little bit loose on me (better than being tight).  They are AMAZINGLY comfortable!  I think they are very stylish too and have already received compliments on them at the office!
These are the worst work shoes I have ever owned. They were incredibly uncomfortable. But the deal-breaker was that they squeaked with every step I took. At first I thought this would improve after the shoes aged a bit but it only got worse with age.
This is my second pair and I love them. I knew hey ran large so I planned for that.
Nice shoes, really enjoyed them.
These are very comfortably made alternatives to their more costly competitors.
Most comfortable shoes I've ever put my feet in!
Very comfortable!
Shoes run a little big but very comfortable.  I would buy again just not wide.
d feet and these help my a lot.
They are too large but I am giving them to someone because I don't have time to return them
Got Half size smaller as I read comments first saying comes big. I wear 8 and got 7.5 fits perfect.
Comfortable but a bit cumbersome.
After only wearing the shoes for one day, 10 hr shift at work, the top of the shoes looks crinkled and lumpy.  I would not buy this shoe again in white.
So the shoes are comfy but of poor quality. By the end of my first week it looked as if I had worn these for months. No so happy about that. I work at a vet hospital so need sturdy shoes. Guess you get what u pay for... Cheap price equals cheap shoes.
I purchased these shoes because I had to have them for school.  Paid for next day shipping so I could have them when I needed them.  I have worn them one day and had to go buy other cheap white shoes that were approved for my clinical class at school.  HUGE waste of money!  I wore them so I can't exchange them.  I have several other pairs of skechers in the size I purchased and they fit well, these are ridiculous big, like a full size if not a size and a half.
No comment
OMG!  I actually bought these at Rack Room Shoes. I have a job where I am on my feet most of the day, but have to appear professional, so I thought they looked better and more suitable than the slip resistant sneaker option. I tried them on in the store (yes they do run big) and thought they felt great.  I wore them to work and liked them...until...I started having ankle and knee pain.  I have never had a sit down job, and I have never experienced ankle or knee pain, until I wore these shoes.  Then I discovered they were Tone-Ups!  Ugh...now I have to go spend more money on a pair of shoes that don't kill my knees!
I buy one size smaller than I normally wear, and they fit perfect.  I have two pairs of these Skecher clogs and they are the most comfortable shoes I've worn in ages.  They have great cushioning unlike the more rigid feel of the Dansko clogs, and wear more like a shoe and less like a clog in that the foot does give and bend.  Awesome shoes... wish they came in more colors.
Very pleased with the price and the shoes, a good quality product at a good price.
Good quality shoe but runs very large. Usually wear 7.5 and 6.5 too big. 6 would have worked but too expensive.
I bought these shoes because they were half the price of the Dansko clogs I originally wanted- this was a giant mistake. These shoes had really poor support and caused me to over pronate which I don't do in any other shoes I own.<br /><br />These also have a squishy bottom, no footbed but the actual sole of the shoe- which makes you work extra hard when you are on your foot for 12 hours during a shift.<br /><br />Terrible shoes. Spend the extra money and by the dansko or sanita clog.
Love, love love these shoes. Exactly what I was looking for. Super comfortable. Lightweight, but durable. I had Dansco's and paid so much for them, so suffered through two years of wearing them. So thankful for this find!!!
I love the shoes. It helps to protect my legs from being on my feet all day. It is very comfortable on my feet. The price is affordable.
I normally wear 9. Ordered a 10. Tad bit big. But feels very comfortable.
I wear these shoes for work. The non-slip sole is perfect for my work environment. These shoes feel like you are walking on air. Because they are built to be slightly large on your feet, I ended up with a 1/2 size smaller than I usually wear, but they fit perfectly. Your feet can breathe and they feel like sneakers with the cushioning. Patent leather looks great and stays nice and shiny. I've been wearing these almost daily for the past few months and they still feel great.
These shoes are great!! I'm on my feet on concrete for 14 hours a day and these keep my feet comfy!! How they last!
Apparently, these shoes are supposed to fit bigger than normal, and they do. At first it was hard to get used to but, after that they are completely fine. They are comfy and provide great arch support.
Great fit very comfortable. I love them.
I love my clogs. They are perfect.
Really comfy at first.  After a few months, they wore out so that my ankles were bent outward. Weird.
Took a while to get them but happy with the quality of the shoes my gf loves them
Just perfect
I would suggest to order these in a smaller size. I myself have flat feet and need extra support around my ankles to keep my feet from hurting and these shoes do not have support around your ankles.
Soft and comfy on the inside. On my feet all day so they help. Little roomy on the sides but all in all a good shoe.
my side view mirror arrived in 4 days and was brand new..Everything works perfectly and my car looks great again.if i could give 10 stars I would:)
i don't recommend for people that have small feet!!
These are great shoes for lab work, but they scuff too easily, & they do run large. I normally wear 7.5-8, but the 7 is still a tad bit big on me.
SHOES WERE SOMEWHAT TIGHT AND WERE HARD TO PUT ON.  NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORN FOR A WHILE THEY FIT FINE.
The shoes in my size were way too large so I exchanged them for a 1/2 size smaller. The fit is still a little loose; so I added a comfy gel insert and they are very comfy. These are nice but I think the design needs some fixing such as a bit tighter in the heel.
Well.....ONE of the shoes is very comfortable lol. The other had the heel lining ripped out when delivered..... I'm either going to just super glue it or return them, just depending on what amazon can do for me. Sign. Pain in the butt.
I found these shoes far too big for my 6.5 feet, but could not be bothered sending it back from one side of the world to the other to get a refund.
These shoes are BY FAR the most comfortable shoe if you are in the medical field and are on your feet all day everyday!~ I have been through many many many shoes to find one that is as comfortable as this pair!~ I now own two pair due to I wore the sole of the first pair out in six months and the shoe did seem to stretch more then I expected. The insert also wore out very quickly. However for the price I would buy a new pair every six months if I have too!~ Love love this shoe!~
Wore them straight out of the box for 16 hours.  Love them.  I work in the Emergency Dept.  I will be buying more pairs of these.
I love these shoes, I have very wide feet and these fit great. I don't have to buy a larger size,as with other shoes. Have worn them all day and very comfortable. Will buy again
I ordered these as a gift for Christmas. Really liked them, so ordered myself a pair. It's true they do run large.. Even if you want them to fit on the loose side I would still do half a size smaller than usual.
I love love my shoes, it's a bit loose but l prefer having it loose than been too fitted. I have been wearing inside since l got it. Will telll you about my first 15 hours shift.
Other than the sizes being off by a size and a half (I usually wear 9, I knew they were big, and ordered an 8 and even that was a half size too big), I have never owned a more comfortable pair of shoes in my life!<br />The arch support is fantastic. I am on my feet all day, I had hip and back pain from bad shoe support, and it's basically all gone thanks to these shoes!
But I am still wearing them
Have to return, I hope my new pair fits. I understand that these fit like clogs, but I would order at least a half size smaller than your normal shoe.
I never thought I would say this, but these are more comfortable than my Danskos! they have great support and a shock absorbing insole. Wore them all day and did fine. I plan on buying them in other colors.
I like the style and comfort, but as for sizing, it's a bit larger.  It's still loose fitting with thin socks.
They are comfortable.
Very comfortable. Yes they are slightly large, glad I read others comments and ordered a small size than normal. No adjustments, my feet didn't take a beating until broken in, they were comfortable from day 1.
Absolutely like walking on cloud 9! I ordered a pair for myself and when I put them on, it was like a foot orgasm.  Also, my daughter's career has her on her feet often as well so I just ordered another pair for her! I Highly recommend these walking shoes!
Great fit, comfortable for all the walking I do at work ....
These shoes  are so comfortable,  no one can tell the difference between these and Dansko's.  They are very light! If you dont want the traditional fit: loose in the heel, go a size and a half down.
Very comfortable. A little big but I have very small feet. I would highly recommend
I have had two of these same shoes before and never had a problem but, for some reason these  are a little to small.  I guess i just have to wear them a little more to see if they stretch out a little.  If not i will have to find a new style of work shoes.
Awesome very comfortable
Best pair of work shoes around!!!
All good
Not happy about the price but i love these shoes.
Best work shoes for waitressing. Always super comfortable.
buy every year because they are so comfortable and they hold up well
Awesome
As advertised. Nice shies
Nice  foot  wear .
I've worn the shoes off and on for about a month, and I am so pleased with the comfort they provide. I'm able to walk around and/or stand for hours without experiencing any of the throbbing pain I dealt with before I bought these. I read most of the reviews before purchasing, and I will echo one complaint I saw on another review - they are HOT. If your feet tend to run hot and sweaty, these shoes may not work out for you as they don't &#34;breathe&#34;. (Personally the comfort is enough where I power through the heat.)<br />I would order these again, and I've already recommended them to others.
Very comfortable
all most goodï¼Œbut the shoe which I got is broken...
Fits a little narrow but other than that the shoes are great. Slip resistant even on greasy floors. Nice arch support to help with tired feet. Approved for my job as well.
very comfortable if youre on your feet all day.
I LOVE THESE SHOES!! I work in the food service industry and these shoes are literally life--and foot--savers! The non-skid soles DO work and the shoes are quite comfy. I have wide feet and wear heavy socks and these shoes run true to size--not tight at all.<br />No, they're not exactly stylish, but for a high quality work shoe that can take a beating, I would  HIGHLY recommend these. This is my third pair ( second from Amazon) and  I would probably cry if Skechers were to discontinue these wonderful shoes!
Arrived sooner than I expected and fit like a glove! Very happy with this transaction!
They are amazing for working in restaurants, super comfy!!
My old &#34;Shoes for Crew Energy&#34; worn out after 1 1/2 years. I loved them but I wanted to try something new so I bought these Sketchers based on great reviews on Amazon. Sketchers fit perfectly and very comfortable from the very first time I put them on. However after a few hours at work in a 2 story restaurant, my feet started getting tired especially on my heels. The next day I put extra insoles hoping that extra support would help. After 4 hours of slow day at work, my heels were so tired and sore.<br /><br />On the third day, I decided to pulled out my old Shoes for Crews and wore them to work. 12 hours of crazy busy day with a lot of walking and going up and down stairs, my feet felt perfectly fine.<br /><br />I don't think I can return the shoes at this point. So I'll give Sketchers a little more time hopefully my feet will adjust, or I will have to spend another $80 for a new pair of Shoes for Crews.
This are very comfortable,but they fit too small.
Very comfortable.
Comfy but not very durable. Killed the after 5 months.
It felt stiff on the first day, but now these shoes feel great on my feet.  Extra shoe laces a plus, and these shoe laces stay on the whole day.  Compare to my previous Skechers, these make me feel taller and perfect my posture, and of course the shipping part was great.
This pair of shoes has lasted me the longest. With the job I have, I am on my feet, on the go, all day long! They were a bit hard to break in but afterwards they have served me well.
I bought two pair of these shoes and I regret it.  They ran smaller and more narrow than any brand I have purchased.  First time I've had to 'break in' a pair of shoes and unfortunately I am on my feet for at least 8 hrs a day! It is like walking on concrete- barefoot. Even the arch inserts that I bought didn't help.  I wasted my money doubly because I bought two and no return packing slip came in the box.  The only thing that may be true of this shoe would be 'slip resistan't but haven't even paid attention because my feet are aching from heel to toe.I still need shoes and my income is not that great so I am stuck wearing these aweful shoes and it makes my day so much worse! I will never purchase this brand again.
What can I say Sketchers are the best for working and walking! Used them all summer long for great hiking and strolling. I will be wearing them back to work in the fall!
This shoe is awesome.. The most comfortable shoes i ever wear.. Highly recommend
Good working shoes.
So far so great! No break-in time necessary, and they are lightweight, and comfortable. I always wear inserts with my shoes to aleviate the aching from standing so many hours, so I don't know how these would be if I didn't have that. But as far as I can see, they are excellent shoes.
I love these Skechers work shoes for women. I have two problems with them. One is they started out around $35.00 a few years ago and just kept going up the more popular they got. I have to search the world to find the lowest price. The second thing is I wear them every day. I am on my feet a lot between working and doing my daily walk they only seem to last about 6 months until the seams start to give way and full apart. I do like the support and they are so comfortable on my feet that you hardly notice you are wearing shoes.
Ugly, but definitely worth it for a working shoe. My job required me to stand on my feet all day and required lots of movement and physical activity. I went through several shoes trying to find a fusion of comfort and style with very little luck. I finally broke down and went for pure comfort which lead me to the purchase of these shoes. While I always felt like someone's grandpa wearing these, and I wouldn't have been caught dead wearing them outside of work, they were well worth the money when it came to what I needed them for. Leg and back pain that had been getting increasingly worse practically went away when I started using these to work in, and I definitely vouch for them in that scenario. Too bad they can't put that kind of comfort into something with a little more style.
Great work shoes, I don't need my orthotics, can wear all day and I am on my feet all day.  Took a few weeks to wear in, but now they are wonderful
Very disappointing tried to wear these three times pain in ball of foot
I had horrible pain being on my feet all day. The first day these arrived I wore them to work and Wow what a difference! I will be buying another set in white very soon!
A great  pair of work  shoes. Skechers are usually  comfortable  highly  recommend
Very comfortable as expected.
Fits very good!
Quick delivery, exactly as expected.
2nd pair of work shoes in almost two years, Sketchers are the way to go for Safe Step shoes.
Good shoes but after a few months they really started hurting my feet.
excellent
I work in the restaurant industry, these shoes are by far the most comfortable I have ever purchased.  Excellent support and comfort!!!!
My wife will not take them off
These shoes are great I ordered a 2 pair they exceeded my expectations
Was looking for something for work in the hospital.  I've had Sketchers in the past and loved them.  These not so much.  Foot bed is very hard and I wasn't even comfortable enough in them to try a shift in them.  Back they go.
Took 2 tries to get correct size. Run a tad small for my daughter's foot but she does have foot issues. She said they were comfortable at first wearing. She's a teenager who works as a dishwasher so she's on her feet. Very non slip. Ugly as sin on her feet but they do the job. She hoses them off after every shift and after a monto they still look new!
Get inserts with these! The bottoms are very hard. I got a 9.5 because I am usually a 9 and use Dr. Scholls with them. I am on my feet for 6-8 hour shifts. They're not as nonslip as you'd like in a sometimes wet restaurant kitchen but they fit nicely and are comfy otherwise.
Solid work shoe esp for the food industry. Not the most fashionable, but comfortable and great quality construction for someone standing on their feet 10-15 hrs a day.
These were the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned. I would defiantly never buy them again. This makes me question Sketchers integrity.
I strongly believe that One Size Dose Not Fit All. What would work for me may not work for you. So I would never tell someone not to buy. I will tell of my experience and read what others have to say about theirs,  That being said.  Skechers for Work Women's Soft Stride Softie. Best walking shoe for me in dry  weather, snow, and rain. Will not slip on wet surface. Well made and last long with good comfort support. Over the years I have purchased 3 pair. Two pair from famous footwear and my last pair from Amazon for a lower price. When I don't have my Skechers on because I'm dressed up they take a ride with me in my SUV. I don't leave home without them. Never know if I have to walk somewhere. Love my Skechers!
Comfortable even after standing for 10 hours.
These sketchers kill my feet. I have to friends with the same one's they said the same. I had to purchase a different brand.
This is my second pair and someof my coworkers are using them as well
I have bought 2 pairs of these shoes and they have been spot on. This order, was my first online order, they are a bit smaller.  Next order, I will order these shoes again I will up the size by 1/2.
Great shoe for grinder shop.  It can be wet & greasy near the grill and these were great non slip shoes.  They also were very comfortable and not &#34;ugly&#34;.  This is my 4th pair. I have another brand but did not like the support.  These are very supportive, especially for a 10 hour day.
This is my third pair of skechers work shoes. I love them they truly non slip. And the give excellent support.
They look like nice shoes but are too wide for me. Even after putting insoles in the shoes the bottom of my feet still hurt
Great Shoes!!!
i needed all black shoes for work and because the reviews where so great i decided to give it a try. Boy what a mistake. I felt like these are way to hard on my feet. I thought maybe it was because i needed to break them in. But even after a month in i found my self ripping off my shoes by the end of my shift. Save up and by something a little better
Most comfortable work shoes I have found. These are my third pair.
What a difference this shoe made at a new job where I am on my feet all day and at 63 years of age this show was heaven sent!
Need good shoes for being on your feet everyday
They are great!  So comfortable for work, I'm on my feet all day, and so supportive
Fabulous shoes for all day wear found had to wear thinner socks as 7 1/2 is what I usually am and they were a bit tight
Second pair of these shoes which are excellent except for minimal arch support. I bought new insole which work great. Otherwise, a excellent shoe especially the slip resistant shoe bottoms.
I am VERY disappointed in these shoes. I needed a good slip resistant shoe to work in. They are even advertised as WORK shoes, but I cannot work in them because they provide no comfort or arch support. After about 2 hours, I am in severe pain. My arches hurt so bad and have even fallen within the handful of days i have worn them! These shoes have damaged my feet! They feel like i am wearing bricks. I do NOT recommend these shoes to anyone. As I said before, I am severely disappointed in these shoes. I expected much better for a name brand shoe. I wish I could get my nearly $73 back for these shoes. Now I have to save up again (which i cannot really afford to do) to buy shoes for work.  :(
I have a pair of sketchers work shoes I've been wearing for years. I decides to try and find some new sketchers work shoes but these didn't have they great arch support my old ones had. They also felt a bit clunky.
I love these shoes!!  They were everything I hoped they would be!  I'm an Officer in a jail and the slip resistant bottom is great. They are light weight an comfy too.
love it
Wife loves them
These sneakers are so comfortable and look really nice on the foot. Love them!!!  BTW, I picked up another pair for myself and another for my Mom.
I have a hard time finding shoes for work that fit and are comfortable enough for the whole day.  These help me stay on my feet to do my job.
They cut to small around the toe area and they hurt my feet
They fit well..
I have been wearing Sketchers sneakers for years. I have flat feet and it is very difficult to find shoes that I can stand to wear. I still have to add expensive inserts but that is just because of my bad feet. I'm sure others can just wear the shoes &#34;as is.&#34;
It's great, very comfortable to wear, but too warm, maybe I can not wear it in summer.
Comfortable for working in on your feet.
I love these shoes.This is my second time buying these.
I don't know where they get their definition of &#34;wide,&#34; but these aren't wide. Still, despite being more narrow than a &#34;wide&#34; shoe should be, they're quite comfortable. A bit snug, but not badly so. No blisters, no sore spots. Supportive, comfortable. The leather gets a bit worn out faster than I'd like. Overall, decent shoes for the price. If your feet are truly wide, however, be prepared for them to be more narrow than you might like.
My wife loves these and it is the second pair I bought her. She is in the restaurant business.
Daughter stands all day. These are all day comfort.
I had the worst experience with these shoes. I tried so hard to trust that they just needed to be broken in but after 2 months of wearing them 6 days a week I can honestly say they are terrible. I got callusus because of them as well as problems with shifting in my toes. I tried a toe spacer, 2 different inserts, and still they fit horribly. Oh and might I mention that I got them after one of my managers at work got a pair. She got them a week before me and already has stitches coming undone and has also had to put inserts in because they were so uncomfortable and caused calluses. I wish I could get my money back
These shoes are a nightmare.  I purchased them because of all the great reviews and the low price compared to other highly-rated non-slip shoes on Amazon.  The first few days I wore them, I hoped the discomfort would go away after breaking them in, but I've been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are just as painful as they were on the first day.  The pain starts within a couple of hours, and by the end of my shift, it radiates all the way up my legs to my lower back.  The word &#34;softie&#34; in the name is very misleading--these shoes feel like bricks strapped to my feet.  They provide zero arch support, and the shallowness of the shoe prevents me from wearing supportive inserts without cutting off circulation in my feet.  I definitely have the right size, as my toe hits in the right place and the shoes are not too wide or narrow.  And to top it all off, these really aren't very slip-resistant.  I've purchased more comfortable, more slip-resistant shoes for half the price from Walmart.  I can't afford to drop another 60+ dollars on a pair of shoes that will only last six months working behind the bar, so I guess I'll have to suffer until these wear out, but you can save yourself a lot of discomfort and choose another shoe.
Well made shoes that are comfortable and reasonably priced. They wear well and look good.
Excellent fit great service!!
These shoes are great and if I were younger and healthier they would probably do everything I need.  As it is, they are more comfortable than any other shoes I have and are not as unattractive as most bulky work shoes.
They hurt my feet after a week, nor comfortable for work environment.
Bought these for my daughter for work , she's on her feet 8 to 12 hours a day .... So far so good, She says they have giving her comfort and all day support and she loves the fact they have the soft gel support inside the shoe. So for the price it's a great buy.
I buy a pair every Fall
These are incredibly comfortable work shoes.  I look like a huge dork in them because they look a little clunky, but they have completely eliminated all of the ankle, knee and hip pains I was experiencing at work before I bought these.  They might be ugly, but they are lifesavers!  When I'm on my feet 6+ hours behind the counter, I need shoes that will support my whole body.  I don't experience swollen feet or ankles anymore, and I know it's because of these shoes.<br /><br />I also added Dr. Scholl's massaging gel inserts and my heels have never felt better!
Good sneakers for all day wear on your feet.
I work all day on my feet at the Post Office, these are very comfortable and I have been complemented on the looks of the shoes
It was for a gift,to a family member, and she loved them .that makes me proud of your service. Thanks
Just what I expected.  My second pair for work!
These were purchased for my mom, she likes them very much.
But they are not comfortable.
USERS BEWARE<br />Do NOT buy this item.<br />I literally bought this and wore it for 8hr shift (mind you that I'm used to this).<br />My old Nikes never had a problem, but this one gave me blisters all over and BLOOD.<br />I couldn't take it anymore and threw it out.
None
Very comfortable, great for being on your feet all day.
I have arthritis in my feet. So, after working 9-10 hour days, my feet are in a lot of pain. I was surprised after wearing these for the first time. By the time I got home from work, my feet were in significantly less pain than normal! These shoes save my stomach from taking to many pain killers. Thanks! I will be buying many more of these.
A little bit too small for regular size.
I'm a waitress, so I'm on my feet all day, I've had surgery on one foot, and have plantar fasciitis in both; these shoes are very close to comfortable which is amazing!  I'm sure I will buy these again.
I love these shoes!! I spend most of my day standing at work and have very sensitive feet. This is my second pair,  I have tried others but there is no comparison. If you need comfortable shoes for work or play these are wonderful.
Comply all the way
Not enough cushion/support as expected. Made back ache
These shoes and very comfortable.  I have a hard time finding shoes that don't hurt ( I have falling arches and I am very heavy - putting a lot of extra weight on already sore feet)<br />These,were comfortable from the first day I wore them, and I can wear them all day at work and all night after work with  NO pain! Very pleased with these shoes and I will continue to buy these .
Great shoe. So comfortable even with 12 hour days on cement.
Very happy with the shoes and service I received.
My wife wears these to work. She couldn't be happier.
Fits great
excelente
Love the shoe , work on concrete 10 hrs 6days .... Been wearing these for years ... Slip resistant....looks more of  dress shoe then gym shoe... Goes great with slacks..   I'm a true 8.5 when I had gained weight I bough 9... Lost weight  8.5 fit like a glove ... I get the wide to wear big sock ....... Got a smaller size 8.5c, all good .....returning 9C
Went online to return shoes, but I  couldn't. I only  had them for 1month and 2days pass return policy. One shoe seams burst and I'm stuck with something I can't wear. Very disappointed and highly upset. Do not buy, it's not worth it!
Just buy your own sole inserts, and you're good to go! I knew beforehand and was prepared to get inserts. and I'm glad i did! because the foot beds in these shoes are paper thin almost, and HARD! but as long as you know before hand, and you get the inserts, no problem :)
Going from a very flat, worn in shoe to this was a little hard to get used to. These are big and clunky and perhaps I made a mistake in getting them wide, which was my fault. It only made them feel bigger. But I got used to them over time and I wear them to walk around all day at work for 8 hours straight pretty much. I think I would still prefer a slightly less heavy shoe, since it feels like I'm being weighed down.
I have had many pairs of these...unfortunately the price is much higher now!
My favorite work shoes
Awesome
First time buying Sketchers shoes and found them to be a little large, but very comfortable..
I am a server and bartender and love theses shoes. Great support, slip resistant and comfortable from day one. I usually wear a 9.5 shoes size but always order these in 9 wide and fit perfect.
Bought a pair of these locally and love them.  Thought I was safe in ordering another pair on-line exactly the same size but no such luck.  The labels match exactly but this pair is smaller and I can't wear them.  I returned them.  Really nice shoes if you can get the right fit..
Wife loves them!  Good looking shoes with great comfort and support. She also says they flex or cushion nicely during stride while walking. She likes them much better than her Sketchers for Work Marathon shoes.
I've been wearing stretchers for years. They fit better and last longer than any other shoes I have ever had.
Shoe is ripping at seams,I just noticed today now I see that I can't return shoe,I'm very unhappy.
Very comfy
COULD USE A LITTLE MORE PADDING IN THE SOLE, BUT THESE REALLY ARE  COMFY SINCE I AM ON MY FEET ALL DAY
I wear these shoes everyday for work and I stand on my feet all day long except for my breaks. You don't have to break them in just put them on and go. love these snaekers
Really good!
Sometimes not comfortable. The shoes are small. I should get a bigger size.
The best work shoe.
Bought this item as a gift. The recipient loves the shoes and stated they were very comfortable.
I have very flat feet. I have been through many shoes. Expensive shoes. These are a cheaper solution to my problems but much much more effective. They are comfortable enough to wear for 10 hours a day on my feet nonstop in a kitchen that is relentless. they clean up nicely and look pretty nice.
i brought these shoes for my daughter who is in nursing school.  She complained that these shoes were uncomfortable and heavy but since she has already worn them, I told her to keep wearing them and see if they stretch out and get more comfortable.  We will see if that helps.
over all its a good shoe Im a chef and I can say after 10hrs my feet start to hurt a little
I bought these shoes because they had good reviews, I have plantar Fisitis I'm on my feet 10-12 a day, I've bought shoes that were $130-150 that were suppose to help my feet but they didnt help with my pain... I bought these Skechers I had them for a week they have helped with the pain I don't have the pain as bad.. I don't know why they call them softies because there are stiff but they do keep your feet from moving around while walking I do recommend these shoes but warn you they are not soft
This is the second pair of these that I have bought.  I work in a lab and often stand for long periods of time, and these shoes do the trick for me.  The support is good, the fit is similar to other skechers I have owned, and the non-slip soles are very nice.  They aren't exactly beautiful, but they are all black.....so they look ok with most outfits.
Overall a good sturdy shoe.
Very pleased
Awesome work shoe. I walk on concrete floors in a prison all day and my feet are happy in these shoes.
Sharp looking. Love them. I will buy again!!
This shoe really is for working in! I go to school and stand on my feet for days when I have my practical.....I'm glad for these.<br />They are a bit bulky but not heavy. I did have to get use to the shoe but it has been good for me all around.
My wife loves how comfortable these shoes are.  The fit was perfect!
I love these shoes
These work well for me.  I am on my feet for a ew hours to several hours at a time. My feet hurt less with zero arch pain.
Good fit..great work shoe, good tread for slip resistance.
I have been ordering these same shoes for years but this particular pair seemed a little snug this time around. I will order wide possibly next time.
These shoes are great for work. I'm on my feet 8-10 hours daily with no pain. Thanks
A++
I LOVE these shoes! They are super conformable! Very pleased with this product!
Shoe fits very nicely. Can't remember when I bought this product but stitching on top of left shoe is gone. I don't work in oil or soap. I'm a janitor in the administration office. Not happy with splitting on top. Sketchers is supposed to hold up better. That's why I bought them.  I'd like to know if sketcher/Amazon will replace shoes.
they should be more breathable
A comfortable work shoe for those of us who need to spend the day on our feet. Great if you must do a lot of walking.
Love theses shoes! So comfortable. My last pair lasted 2 years, serving 5 days a week!!
I work as a waitress/bartender and needed some slip resistant shoes.  These have worked beautifully.  They are comfortable and I can work long stretches in them quite easily.  They definitely help keep me from sliding around on greasy kitchen floors.  I am very happy with them and would purchase again.
My wife normally wears size 8 shoes. However, she had to exchange the size 8s originally purchased for a size 8.5 because the size 8 was too small. However, she really likes the shoes; says she can wear them all day -- no problem. Light weight, comfortable and the soles do not slip at all.
I wear these shoes almost every day and I have to say they are the MOST COMFORTABLE shoes I have ever worn.  These are fantastic if you are working on your feet all day and need a good shoe to keep your feet comfortable.  I wore them on concrete floors all day long and although my feet were a little tired feeling, it was SO MUCH BETTER than any other shoe I have worn.  I only wish they made the shoe a bit more stylish, black shoes seem like they are orthopedic and are somewhat sterile.  But honestly as I tell everyone, I care much more about comfort than fashion.  I'd rather have happy feet than have someone complement me on how pretty my shoes are.  To each their own, but if you care about comfort I truly recommend this shoe!
Ok so I normally wear a 7.5/8 depening the brand, so I ordered a 8W in these and I do have a little extra room, although if I would've ordered a smaller size they most likely wouldnt have fit. These are very stylish for work shoes, and very comfortable.  Im a heavier set young women and im on my feet everyday 8+ hours these help more then any other shoe I have tried to comfort my feet with. Another neat thing is the sole can be removed in these and you can get your own inserts that accommodate your feet of the ones provided dont do enough. I love these shoes. Even make me a little taller ;)  Update: wayyyy later I'm now buying a 2nd pair of these I love them so much!
These are the best work shoes I've ever owned. I work long hours as a server in an upscale busy restaurant and these are non-slip and extremely comfortable. They are durable like tennis shoes but can be work with Tuxedo pants (for a work uniform) and look like they fit the uniform. The price can be a little on the expensive side but one pair lasted me for 2 years working full time. I normally wear an 8 1/2 (normal width) but in these I wear an 8 wide and they fit like a glove.
I ordered these shoes for work. I work in a correctional facility that requires specific footwear. These shoes have a leather-like look and clean easily. I also work on concrete floors that can get very slick, so the non-slip soles are important and have held true to their word. I also stand for periods of time and they are pretty comfy. I have other sketchers shoes and these are true to fit. I usually have to go about a half size up from other brands of shoes. I recommend them highly.
Good.
Nice shoes
Quick exchange for half size bigger and fit perfect. Very comfortable and excellent service.
love the shoes, bought for work and they are exactly what I needed.  Great support and look good with pants.
I love these shoes! Very happy!
Great work boots. They will last forever.
These shoes say they have memory foam, but it is only in the heel.  The rest of the sole is HARD AS A ROCK!!!  I am returning them because they were uncomfortable just from trying them on.  Price is right but definitely not a shoe I would wear to work in all day.
I use it at work, itâ€™s a bit tiny wide because I wearing thin sock, great for long standing hours.
There is 0 support in this. This is not a work shoe but Im stuck with it. Hopefully the insoles I put in them will help. At least the bottom inside layer comes off easy so you can put in real support but here you are spending 10+ bucks to make these shoes comfortable. Hope these end up working in the end. Ive already wasted money on them.
Great shoes. Very comfortable and durable. Needed to exchange because size was too big. I normally wear a 7 and I had to get a 6. Return process through Amazon was super easy though.
These shoes are cut a bit big, but that is how they are advertised.  I usually wear an 8.5 or 9 wide.  I purchased the 8.5 wide and they are roomy.  Not too much room that they would slide off the back of your heel though.<br />Very comfortable memory foam insoles.
They are a bit heavy when I walk.
I thought the shoes were leather but they are plastic/memory foam. They look like men's shoes but they will be fine for work.
My back hurt when I wore them all day. They are heavy. I wish they fit better and were lighter!
Good shoes but run large I ordered one size down from my normal size . The insole is really thick so I swap it out for a thinner one and now they fit perfect.
I listened to all reviewers and bought a half size smaller than my real size .  They were right.  The half size smaller was perfect.  Very comfortable shoe.  Great price!
I had to return.  Bought the size I normally wear and these were at least a full size to big.
I love these work shoes!  They were a little stiff to begin with but are breaking in nicely! These shoes run very large.  I read many reviews on these shoes and took the advice of others and ordered 1/2 sz smaller.....I should have ordered a full sz smaller as they were still a little loose.  I put a Dr Scholl's arch support insert in them and they fit comfortably now.  I would recommend them for comfort as well as style!
I haven't been impressed with Sketchers work in the past, but these shoes have really impressed me! I ordered my regular size and they have plenty of room in the toes, which is perfect for my bone spurs. I can wear these shoes 14 hours a day without any pain!
LOVE THESE SHOES!  Fast shipping and just as described.
Far too narrow for me.  May have been OK if available in wide widths.
Very big and clunky
Most comfortable safety shoes that I have ever had.  The toe box is a good size and doesn't crush my toes, which has always been a problem for me.
Love love love these shoes! I wear them to work every day and they are so comfortable. They can be worn with dress pant or jeans.  They might be a little too wide for a narrow foot, since they fit me perfect and I usually wear wider shoes. Thank you Skechers for these amazing shoes!
I am glad I ordered a 1/2 size smaller.  They are still big in the toe/ball of foot area.  They brand them as a relaxed shoe.  I guess I am not a &#34;relaxed&#34; kind of person.  I would prefer a shoe that fit a little better.  My foot slides around inside this shoe.  I think I prefer my Eastland's better.  Still not a horrible shoe.  If normal shoes are a bit tight for you....then this is your magical slipper.
Ordered these for serving job and they look really nice, they're not super heavy like I was worried about. They seem to be just fine as non-slip and arrived on time. The only concerns I have are that I am gonna need to put some insoles in but I imagine I'd need to for any shoes for me so that's not a big deal, but food tends to get stuck on the bottom which is really annoying.
Shoe is extremely comfortable, but unfortunately runs very big.  Having to return and order smaller size. After receiving the smaller size I am extremely satisfied with the shoe.  I recommend ordering a full size smaller than you normally wear.
Great product. Fits as expected.
I bought these because they had memory foam, crocs are not very comfortable to stand in all day without having some form of additional support.  have flat narrow feet but after 3 to 4 weeks of wearing these for 8+ hours a day they are now very stretched out and uncomfortable.
very comfortable
These are very good shoes for work shoes. I was just disappointed that they weren't very wide, my feet felt pretty snug. The arch support is great, which is what I was looking for. And my job reimbursed me for the price fully and they are 100X better than what I was originally given as a shoe.
Being on concrete floors eight hours, five days a week, work shoes last three months for me.  These were no different.  Which is fine, but I was disappointed that the memory foam insole was super thin.  I wear my shoes out on the inside, around the heel.  These outlasted any other pair I've bought.  The thing that annoys me about these shoes is that they squeak after about a month of wearing them.  It's very annoying in a hospital setting.  I bought a second pair to give them a second chance.  They squeaked as well.  So, for that reason I will not be buying them again.
Fabulous work shoes!  Ditto pretty much all of the other reviews!
I love this shoe! I love the fact I can be on my feet for about 4 hours before they start to hurt and I will definitely buy these again when the tred wears out.
Love them!
I have a wide foot and could not get these to go past the middle (dorsal) to even try them on completely. These were ordered in the size I normally wear so they are sized small. I tried a second time with a bigger size and found the same problem. The Dorsal part does not stretch to allow a wider foot to go in.
I work long hours in the restaurant as a server. These shoes have memory foam only in the heel, and then it drops off for the rest of the foot, causing pain in the middle of my feet. Disappointed. I paid more money than I ever have thinking my feet would thank me. They were also a bit smaller than usual. I wear a 7.5 in a sketcher sneaker so was hoping these would fit the same. Tried the 8, and they were too big, just slipped off at the heel.
These are great.
The back of the shoe is too short, causing slipping and blistering of my heel.  I also read all the reviews before purchasing and ordered them a size larger than what I wear and they were still too small.  I'm returning them.
Nice looking shoes. Not good for 13 hour days. Maybe I should have ordered one size larger. Or maybe they should sugest to order one size larger.
like had to send back sent to different sizes-once they got wet they shrunk as well
Shoes do not have enough cushion at ball of foot. Looking for comfort when on feet 12+ hrs.
The shoes fit my mother well.
I have been a waitress for 15 yrs and have never worn shoes that I didnt have to 'break in' at first. These shoes were confortable and fit perfectly from the first day!! My legs and back are not sore anymore like they used to be from that marble floor I walk on all day long!!! You have a loyal buyer from now on!! Thank you!!
Good
A bit tight but will loosen over time very comfy
Cursed with wide flat feet - hard to find good shoes that don't kill my feet. Skechers are my go to shoe for comfort. Love memory foam.
I had to buy arch supports for these shoes and I don't have a high arch.
I waited a few days before doing the review.  I was happy with the size, especially since they are slip-ons.  I use inserts too for extra cushioning and the inserts actually make them fit a little more comfortable. I wear a 7 and have a normal width foot.  They didn't have as much memory foam as I had hoped, so not quite as cushiony as some other skechers.  They are pretty good at being slip proof, which I really needed.  The down side is after wearing them all day (10 hrs +) my feet are killing me. If it is 6 hrs or less I am okay with them.  Think I will use them on less busy days at work and where my shifts are shorter, they do look nice.  I will use my more tennis shoe looking skechers for the longer shifts as they have better cushioning.
Great shoe
These are the perfect work shoes. A few years ago I had ankle reconstruction and I can no longer wear boots at work. I will never buy anything else! Love them!!! I work a 12 hours shift and my feet no longer hurt from working all day. I have noticed that my back doesn't hurt as bad at the end of the shift either. If you are looking for a great work shoe, this is it.
These shoes were great. Finally had to replace them. Got good use out of them and didn't have to wait long for shipping. They really are non slip and fit good
Too narrow for my medium foot.  Gave them to a friend with a slightly narrower foot (though also a medium) and she loves them.
I was excited to get these shoes.  There were so many positive reviews.  I have not had the great experience others have had. Within an hour the ball of my foot and my toes are in extreme pain. I work for hours on a very hard concrete floor.  By the time my shift is done, I am in serious pain.  I know that skechers have an excellent reputation and many people I know personally have had a completely different experience from mine with their skechers.
perfect
wonderful work shoes. I usually buy shape ups which i work all day in.Tried these for a switch. worked 9 hours on my feet with no problem.like the fact that its a lighter shoe. my one improvemt would be a thicker sole for working on harder floors.
Wear them for an hour!!!! When the box arrived I put them on and instantly was disappointed. They felt tight and I was going to return them. However, after about an hour they fit wonderfully! Super happy with my work shoes!
Good working shoes. Glad I bought it.
Shoe was much wider than a normal width had to return.  Think they would be comfortable.
Wife has tough time finding this small shoe size (5) that fits well.
Purchased it for my spouse, and she says it feels like wearing no shoes, and are very comfortable!
They are great except they squeak on tile floors.  They sound like i am making balloon animals all day long.
One of my favorite pair of shoes they are really springy. Wear em with socks if you plan on standing on your feet or walking around a lot.
I purchased this shoes because I presume it was a sketcher,and it would be comfortable for use for 12 hours. I use it for work now whenever I'm not going to do the long hours. I was disappointed that it was not as comfortable as I expected for a sketcher.  It also run a little small.  I should have brought a half size bigger, even though I don't feel the level of comfort would have increased.  Maybe I would have had more space for extra padding.  I stayed with it, because I do not want to spend more money to return it.  I think it is already pricy.
I am a baker and wore these shoes for 8+ hours a day. I thought I would give them a try since they were half the price of the Keens I had before. I'd have to say I will not be buying these shoes again. They took 3 weeks to break in and killed my feet during that time. They also turned the toes and heels of all my socks black. They wore out after only 3 months of wear. I went back to my Keens and don't regret it. Saving half the price was not worth it at all.
These shoes are very comfortable. Great purchase.
I like the the shoes, they are just to wide in the heel area as I have narrow heels.  Had to put more enter soles in the shoes in order for them to fit good.
I read reviews, thought wow most be great shoes. I am on my feet 8 and half hours at work. They have no support in the upper part of the shoe. My feet ache all night and after I take my shoes off.  Was a waste of money. Got a blister on my little toe to. My converse would be more comfortable at work and he shoes. I love Skechers  shoes I was very disappointed :(
ware them for work every day
Works well in greasy areas.
Too small my wife didn't like them looked great but just too small
Too small but they felt so comfy, I didn't want to send them back. Instead I bought a different skechers shoe with more flexibility. I'll see if that fits the bill.
Necessary evil for work. Decent price
not for folks who have high arches
This shoe fits perfect and is very comfortable because I'm on my feet for 8 hours a day.
Couldn't wear these shoes for a full day before they hurt my feet. Bought new insoles for them and it didn't help. I would not buy these again.
I got a size 9 and I could swim in them. I actually wear an 8.5, but get a 9 for the toe room. The 8.5 are not anywhere close to be relaxed fit.
These shoes were somewhat tight at first in terms of height, but fit almost perfectly after being broken in. They don't completely stop my feet from hurting, especially after 8+ hour shifts, but they are way more comfortable than the shoes I was wearing before.
These shoes are very comfortable... That being said I wish the size actually fit.. I wear a size 9 and I ordered that and it's really small on me. The first time i tried them on it felt a little snug but I figured that it would fit better in about a week, which it didn't. Breaking them in did nothing and now I can't return them cause I wore them for a week. What a huge waste of money.
Great for work. Fits good and easy on feet
I love the shoes I work in a restaurant and they are perfect. The only thing with Amazon is they never send a return up or invoice .
I loved these shoes so much for working behind the bar that I bought another pair. They are comfortable and durable.
i was a little disappointed the memory foam was just at the heel and not the whole sole like my other shoes. it was more like just an insert
Shoe is very comfortable and stylish! However, I only gave 4 stars because I got holes in my shoes in about 3 months of owning them. Not what I expected from Skechers, I buy their products all the time and this is the first time a pair of shoes got holes in them so fast. I only work 2 days a week in a restaurant so this should not have happened.
Love love these shoes
It's taken me awhile to find shoes that give me the support I need for my plantar fasciitis.  I bounce when I walk in them and they are very comfortable.  I place the cork lifts provided by my doctor under the lining and I'm good to go.
The best work shoes I've ever had! So comfy! I'm on my feet all day every day and these are awesome
Fits great
I love these shoes my second pair and they fit perfect.
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!! I am on my feet as a server all day and my feet feel great with these shoes!!! Worth every penny!!!! My Co-workers are buying them now! They are light weight and easy to clean too! Perfect arch in the shoe!
Needed  a good pair of shoes for work  and they do the job.
These shoes are very comfortable and they do not slip at all on wet floors. My feet haven't hurt at all since I got them I love the gel insoles
Shoes are very comfortable and stylish. Only drawback is that leather is not the best quality. Looks and feels fake, for the price the leather should be a better quality.
Great shoe. Only complaint is it needs much more arch support. Once I popped in some store bought arch supports, they were perfect.
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PAIR OF SKETCHERS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!  I never needed to break these shoes in!! Will DEFINITELY buy another pair!!!
Broke down far too quick. Not very durable for why I do. They are very soft though, which is great for long standing on concrete.
These shoes are average.  The support could be better.  After several months wearing them, they have stretched out a bit.
I have yet to wear them all day on the job yet but I love the style and fit. Next week will be the test since I'll be moving for 6 or 7 hours on concrete floors.
On my feet all day on concrete floors!  I also have sciatica pain and these are very good for all of that!
I love these shoes! I am on my feet a lot during the day for work and also walk a lot for work as well. These shoes are super comfortable and look nice with a pair of dress pants. I always wear them. When first worn, expect that they will feel tight but you just have to break them in and once you do, you will always want to wear them to work because they're so comfortable. My arch is supported and the bottoms of my feet feel cushioned.  At the end of the day, I don't have aching feet like I usually do when I wear other shoes for work. If you're a work in the office or on your feet all day, buy these shoes - it's a great investment for your feet!
they are comfortable but I find the go walk 2 even more comfortable for all day wear.
Not quite right for UK sises, very comfortable tho,
Not true to size. I normally wear size 8 so I ordered a 8 1/2 and couldn't even get my foot in these shoes. Very disappointed!
I'd like to send then back.
Still breaking them in but pretty happy with them so far. :)
I am on my feet for 8+ hours a day (on cement floors) as a bakery manager (and in those hours I walk about 5 miles a day).  I love these because they are light weight, very comfortable and supportive.  I'll definitely be buying these again!
I bought the shoes for work and they're very comfortable.
Have a bad back. Needed something that wasn't a sneaker to wear to the office with pants. These served me well throughout the winter season.
Not very comfortable.
Great shoe for comfort and fit.  I wear these for work.  I give them an A++
I add my own inserts, so they are a little tight, but sturdy shoes and I will be purchasing them again.
Comfortable and light
Great shoe for food service workers.. Great support for the heel and excellent traction on wet floors
On my second pair after a year of wear. Love these shoes! Wear them all day, everyday.
I ordered these shoes as I was required to have no-slip work sole shoes for my job.  I had previously worn my &#34;Go Walk&#34; shoes by skechers, which seem to be a very similarly built shoe to this one.  I thought that they were the same shoe, but different materials.  They are slightly heavier than the Go-Walk, and a little clunky.  Overall, the shoe fits a little larger than my other skechers. I normally wear a 9, and they slipped in the back a little bit, but a half size smaller would have been too small.  The shoe does not stretch much, but does keep your feet dry if you step in puddles.  The bottom non-slip factor is fair, still a little slippery if you are walking on wet floors, yet much better than regular shoes.  They do have padded insoles, and I wore them up to 12 hours on my feet at a time but chose to add gel insoles for more comfort.  These shoes are not very breathable, and are not adjustable.  I'm not searching for new shoes yet, but would probably look for something different next time around.
They are exactly what I needed. They are perfect for wet kitchen floors in food establishments.
The 9.5 was slightly small, just too tight around the toes.<br />The 10 was slight large, just too large around the ankle. I contemplated buying an ankle insert. Instead I  returned both.<br /> am typically exactly a 9.5, sometimes a 10 in certain shoes. They were just enough off that I wasn't willing to test breaking them in on 12 hour shifts.<br /><br />They were cute, and could have been really comfy if the fit was better for me.
Nice and Very confortable for work.
As comfortable as expected
I love them very much.  They are very comfortable
Great shoes! Comfortable & stylish enough for work. Not bulky like my clogs.
Great shoe. That is all. Lol
For me these shoes are just okay. If I worked at a place that had differnt tile or carpet they would probably be great. I need more support for the 8-12 hr days I work on my feet.
Once I wore to work, they stretched a little.  Shoe loose in feet and therefore not very comfortable.  Fit is true to size.  Other than that liked the look of this work shoe...
When they first arrived they were a bit tight in the width, however after a few days of wear they loosened up enough for comfort. Sizing is always tricky for me as I fall some where between a ten and an eleven. With this shoe the eleven is a little long but still wearable.
I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!!! I work two jobs & am on my feet for long periods .One job is waitressing so I have to have non skid shoes also.  I have a non existent arch, have had two surgeries on my right foot-one for a bunion, the second to move bone over on the top plate. I know have plantar fasciitis on my right foot & a bunion (trying to put off surgery) on my left. I have spent $100's of dollars on shoes for comfort and still by the end of the evening can barely walk. I did a search for shoes for bunions & these pulled up so I thought what the heck, they're cheap, I have nothing to lose. These shoes are literally like walking on a cloud. I can not believe how comfortable they are & how my feet are killing me at the end of the evening. If you have problem feet I highly recommend these shoes!
These are the most comfortable  work shoes I have found!
I had to return these shoes three times in order to get the correct size to fit. They are sized larger than normal. Other than that they are a good shoe.
Very comfortable!
I got them for my mom for work and she LOVED them....
I ordered these to work in a hospital.  I had foot surgery last year, so I already wore the fabric Sketchers in this style.<br />I was disappointed in the &#34;memory foam&#34; insole.  It basically had one little bump of foam.  I took those out & replaced<br />them with Gel insoles.  Now the shoes are great!  They are sturdy, have a thick non-slip sole and are easy to clean.<br />(No one is saying they're beautiful.)
I tried on shoes in the store and felt awesome, but after wearing them 8 hrs on the job, the memory foam didnt seem to work and cushion felt like it was non existent. I have issues with my feet (heels) so its really hard to find work shoes that WORK for my needs. Upside? No laces and slip resistant and sorta dressy for work.
I usually pay a lot more for a comfortable pair of work shoes. The memory foam is awesome , I will buy more in the future
I purchased these for my daughter; she is pleased they fit well and are comfortable.They arrived on time and I would recommend.
A little  bit  large but thicker socks make a good fit the shoes are really  comfortable especially if you are on your feet all day.
Bought for my girlfriend. She said they were a lot more comfortable than the ones we got from pay less. She needed nonslip(being a server)and she wanted slip on but just wasn't keen on the style. Said she didn't see pic. Before I purchased. I'm a guy, What do I know about style?  Thought they looked fine.
My daughter could not get past her instep
I have been shopping for a really good pair of new work shoes for several weeks. As a restaurant manager I stand and walk my entire shift every day.  I found these shoes on Amazon and couldn't believe how great the reviews were, so I decided to buy a pair.  I LOVE THESE SHOES!  They are the most comfortable shoes I have owned in my 15 years of hospitality experience. They are very very comfortable, light weight, a good fit, slip resident and shock proof.  I have not had a single leg cramp since I purchased these shoes (roughly a month ago.)  I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone that stands and walks a lot at work. They are seriously like a dream, and honestly look pretty sharp. I was concerned they would be too macho, but they're actually not bad at all.  Point blank...these shoes are a great buy. Will definitely purchase again in the future as long as hey hold up well.
I work in a kitchen all day long  and usually go through shoes pretty quickly and these have lasted quite some time and they are really easy to clean.I love the slip on style and it has decent support with no more achy feet:)
Great shoes but they are a little wide through the heel and slip up and down.
Quite comfortable
Very comfy.
Perfect fit. Very comfortable for standings long periods of time.
These shoes are amazing! I have had these shoes for about 2 weeks now no breaking in! I'm a server and they fit perfect. Very comfortable so glad I got these shoes I have seen them in the store for 70 so this is a great deal so if you're trying to decide like I was buy these shoes you will be happy! (Your feet will be happy too)
The most comfortable shoes for work I ever bought!!! I'm on my feet 10-12 hrs a day... And at the end of the day my feet feel well... I definitely going to keep buying them!&#34;
Very good and comfortable. I love it!
I am recovering from a fractured foot and inflamed tendon issues. My tendon has healed and I will avoid surgery by using good footwear. I feel really comfortable in this shoe and I walk a lot!
I usually wear a size 8 1/2 wide so I ordered a size 9. I couldn't even get my foot in the shoes and sent them back for a refund. My husband wears the equivalent of a women's size 7 and they fit him just right in width though they were too long.
They are very comfortable to work in.
She loves these and they feel light on her feet! She stated the work lace shoes feel heavier generally when in comparison! These don't hurt the top of her feet or causing too much pressure on her calves! She loves them! Now let's monitor durability!
I bought these for my daughter for work. She says the are comfortable but had to put a thicker insole in them.she couldnt thank me enough.
wasn't able to get the shoe on, the opening didn't have enough give to allow entrance. they were sent back i'll try another size
Comfortable!!!!!!
These shoes fit snug for about a week , and then they loosened up so much that they slide up and down when I walk. They would be ok if I had a wide foot.
They are comfy.
Love  them
Love them
I was very pleased with this purchase..The fit was perfect and they are very comfortable. Did not even have to break them in. If you have high arches however you may need inserts. Very pleased with the price. Wouldn't have bought them without first reading the reviews first. They were very helpful.
As per my wife:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very comfortable.<br />Water resistant.<br />Attractive.<br />Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Need to replace insole for one with a higher arch if needed.<br />Does not take well to scratches and scuffs.
I'm on my feet 9-10 hours a day 6 days a week.  These shoes are just wonderful!  I have the GoWalk version that I loved when on vacation so I was very excited to see these as work shoes!  I have a knee injury from the military, so finding something that lets me stand all day and not have any noticeable pain is great!  I have tried many different types of work shoes.  Not only are these comfortable but they are very affordable!  I will be recommending these to everyone!
Great shoes. The were just too big so I returned them. Free returns so that was great.
I was expecting to wear these all day but about 4 hours into my day I have to switch shoes.
Sent as shown.  Worthy of trust.  Works well.
Fits very tight and uncomfortable.
These shoes are made of quality leather.  Yes, they were a little snug when I first put them on.  As with most of my shoes, I wear them around the house for a few days to limber them up.  By the 3rd or 4th day, these were ready to wear all day.  I wore them on my Chiropractor visit & she commented how much she approved of the support they give me!!! I if I wear any other shoe, she reprimands me & tells me I really should be wearing these.
Very comfortable
I've been waiting tables for years and these are the ONLY shoes I've ever felt comfortable in after work, even after working a double shift and standing for up to 13 hours straight.
Very comfortable . A little larger than size 7 which I am.
Looking for a replacement for the Sketchers Shape Ups for work.  These are not it.  Please bring back the shape ups for work.  Only shoes that don't hurt my feet with long shifts. These shoes are not horrible they are not what I wanted them to be. The slip resistant is good and the shoes are in excellent shape.  They do fit a bit smaller and narrower than other shoes.
Good
very good shoes and be good to work in this summer
Wow, these shoes are great for me. I'm on my feet at work for 10 hours a day.
Very comfortable work shoe
I was at first a little worried that I might have made a mistake in ordering my true size (9) as I have a bunion on my left foot that gives me pain.  With any other shoe for work in the restaurant industry, I usually buy a half size up to allow for extra room and buy an extra pair of insoles for cushion.  However, after reading reviews and knowing that Amazon Prime allowed me free returns if I needed it, I went ahead and ordered my true size.  From the moment I put them on, my foot pain and leg pain after long hours in our restaurant was GONE!  They fit perfectly from the first moment, and I look forward to buying more pairs of this shoe!  The price was perfect, and the fit is awesome.  Thank you, Amazon, and Skechers!
I had to add an insert but these hold up well to an 8 hour shift on my feet.
I have wide feet and normally wear size 10 running shoes.  It took about 1 week to break the shoes in to fit me properly.
Very comfortable
These shoes are very comfortable and the style of them is nice without looking to bland. I tried them on in a store before I bought them. 9.5 is my size and it fits fine. The band around the top is a bit snug for the top part of my feet (I have more fat on the top of my feet). But have stretched over time the past week or so. If you walk a lot they will break in real quick. I like the extra cushion in the heel, since I put most of my weight on my heels. I assume this will help give them longer life via the soul. Because there is extra padding in the heel, when I put them on I feel like my heel is just barely in the shoe. But they have not slipped out(the back part of the shoe sets just below the bend at the back of the foot)  I'm assuming it's just me because I have been wearing the same worn out shoes for three years. I walk on gravel most of the time at work, these shoes have good traction. Comfy comfy comfy, will buy again if still available when these ones wear out.
Im a hairdresser and these shoes are GREAT!
I loved
they do make my feet less tired, but at the same time they are kinda big and I do feel a minor slip when I walk on oil.  It also depends on how my foot is in the shoe because I do feel it hurts my arch a little.
Comfortable
At the present time I'm trying to find arch supports that will help to make these shoes fit better.  The are a little small but if I can get better arch supports for them and am able to wear them longer they should stretch out some.
I've been able to wear these shoes for a 6-8 hour restaurant shift on the 2nd day of use without foot pain, although for me these shoes do squeeze a bit more than I'm used to around the heel area. Plenty of toe room, I like the way they look, and they go on and off easily without feeling too loose. I will probably look for additional inserts for better arch support and cushioning, but they exceeded expectations for the price!
I am very satisfied with my Skechers shoes.That is very important for me and my foot,I am working on the hard surface and then they are very comfortable walking and work footwear,I love it ðŸ˜Š.Thanks again .
Comfortable, size is larger than normal for my size.
they were so narrow that I couldn't even get my foot inside the shoe.  larger wouldn't work, need much wider.
Very comfortable at work
Tight for a relaxed fit shoe
Returned them, I got blisters on the bottom of my fit.
After two hours of a ten hour day these shoes Hurt My Feet! Miserable long workdays. Housekeeping room. Inspector. I typically walked 5-7 miles each day. Stairs and long halls.<br />The feel and fit if the leather upper was nice and snug and soft.<br />The gel at the heel was good and prevented &#34;stone bruising&#34; but the toe of the shoe insole is hard! And caused aching feet.<br />The shoes soles are stiff and not very flexible and i felt i was walking flat footed.
Very comfortable shoe for someone who has problems with their feet
long hours in these memory foams are working great so far!
I love the shoes, it's like walking on cloud 9.
Looks good and very comfy! Will buy it again!
Very nice shoes
Good work shoe, very impressed with the comfort. I wear a ankle brace for comfort and these shoes allow me enough room to were the brace while at work.
I use orthotics
I love them that is why I paid $80 for them last year so when I seen them on Amazon for $40 dollars I had to have them... However they seem to run smaller... And wish there would've been an option for the shoes in wide.
Solid $40 shoe. Only worn them 3 times so far for long shifts. Feel great so far.
Very comfortable shoes but they squeak so loudly on linoleum floor with EVERY step! I am a nurse and it is so embarrassing that I can't wear them to work. I live in Aus so can't even return them. I am so disappointed to find such a comfortable shoe that cannot be worn.
I am returning them.
Fits perfectly great purchase
Fit perfect... No sliding in the restaurant I work in. Will purchase again. Fast delivery.
Not for wide feet
They were a little tight I ordered an 8 and I am a 7.5. No room to put my insoles. Comfortable, I've been a waitress for 5 years and they are more comfortable than the 100$ pair I bought at a local Work and Gear. Still not sure how they will work out I've worn them 3 shifts And my feet still feel the same ache they always do!  Lol
Perfect fit !!!!
Fits me so good<br />Love it!
I work in fast-food and on my feet for eight hours of the day. I love these shoes. I feel like I am walking on clouds. I will be buying another pair.
I have other Skechers shoes that fit very comfortably. This style was too tight in the toes. My toes are right against the tip of the shoes. Had to send them back.
Fits very well, very comfortable shoe for work great price and wonderful seller quick postage!!!!
a little tight at first, but are breaking in fine. I would recommend ordering the exact size you wear as another other shoe.
Perfect fit
The right side was a little wide and the left size snug.
Not really comfortable as what I expected, but looks good for work. It's way too big for me and still, I have to buy thick socks.
Shoe cold be alot more comfy if the memory foam was thru the whole shoe...instead its only at the heel
Fairly comfortable but not enough support for standing all day. Also they claim to be non slip but they are slippery in kitchen and walk in freezer. Would not buy again.
very nice
Was a bit scared on buying theses shoes but I love them. I normally got shoes for crews. They are comfy,lightweight, and truly slip resistant. I have gotten others from stores and slid all over the place..I have only had them a few weeks but so far so good. Hopefully they will last awhile
Love the relaxed fit! Finally a Sketchers that's wide enough for my bunion to not hurt.
white pair is on my list!!!
Just what I needed for my job. Thanks
These shoes are great.  Super comfortable all day (I run around on pavement for about 6-8 hrs/day.  Only one problem!  One of the shoe lace strap thing broke!!  I was very disappointed.  Happened on the second day.  Well, I just continued wearing them and so far no problems (it's been a week and 1/2 now.  Very comfy with the memory foam.  If I start having problems with them due to the missing lace loop I'll write another review.
Great Delivery and Service, but can't wear, these are made on the smaller size. I wear 8.5 but these fit really tight. My other sketchers fit great was trying replace for work. I threw away box so can't return. My own fault. 9 are usually to big.
Great slip resistance.  Had the slip on version for two years, loved them.
Comfortable for the first 8-9 hours of my 10-13 hour work days. Tried to use insoles but the shoe is more comfortable without them. If you work 8 hour shifts they will be fine. I have wide feet so I ordered a 7 1/2 instead of a 7 and they fit great.
I am a manager at a fast food restaurant, so I am on my feet 8hrs. a day. The shoes feel like your feet are being hug by a pillow, super cushionie, with a good deal of support. They have taken most of my foot pain away. They are not a magic cure all for foot pain but they help a great deal.
They work for work
I work in the Paint Shop at Nissan and the shoes fill real good working on grates that has matting on them.  This shoe helps support my ankles now the real test will be how long they hold up.  Right now I would give this shoe a 5 star rating for fit and comfort....
Love these shoes. Am on my feet 5 - 8 hours at a time. They are so comfy.
I have been wearing Skechers work shoes for years, mostly the Shape up soles, but these Sure Track Trickel slip resistant with the memory foam inner sole, are FANTASTIC! Will continue to buy these, hope they last the 12-18 months my previous shoes have .
As a server/bartender, I'm on my feet constantly. I've been ordering from &#34;shoes for crew&#34; for the longest time, but the quality and consistency has gone downhill. I tried Danskos, but couldn't seem to get them to break in. So as I was searching the web, I came across these Sketchers. I've been wearing them for a week now and absolutely love them. The only bad thing I can say is I wish they looked a little classier under my black work slacks. But I'll take comfort instead!!
Looking for good work shoe for my farm.  This fits the bill.
I love these shoes, they fit so well
So far sooo comfortable
I just got these and haven't had a chance to really wear them. I am hoping they will fit comfortably for many hours
Nothing more comfortable than Sketchers with memory foam!
Sketchers said Leather shoes it wasn't Didn't like with way they fit or supported when I walked a terrible shoe.
Love these shoes, Normally I wear the sketchers Softies, but wanted to try something new. Great, well made shoe and the memory foam is a great bonus.
Love these shoes, very comfortable for work!
Very comfortable. Excellent and comfy work shoes.
I just received my shoes! They came in two days and the fit is awesome. I work about 13 hours a day and these shoes are holding up wonderfully. And the price is a steal.
best non-slip i have ever owned, shoes are very comfy, like walking on a cloud. ive had them for 3 months now and no issues or wearing.
Super comfortable. Delivery right on time.
I love them, fit perfect and very comfortable to.i work all Day on my feets and I need confy shoes. I glad I boughten. Thank you every one , because the reviews help me decide to get them.. Nice good shoes .
love these shoes
so comfortable im so happy with these shoes ! i work long shifts as a waitress and I would tell anyone to buy them !
Good work shoes. VERY COMFORTABLE. This was my third purchase.
love them
Very nice work shoes
Very comfortable
Right size
mother was very happy them..espcially working a job that mostly is all walking..she was very happy
These by far are the most comfortable work shoes I have purchased on Amazon.
They are not the most handsome shoe, but if you are on your feet all day long then these shoes do the job perfectly
Fits like a glove. Super comfy. Didn't even need to be broken in!
I am a letter carrier.  Love the comfort of these shoes.
This is my second pair of work shoes and I love them.  They are so comfortable and my feet does not get tired. Would recommend them to anyone who is in the work field or does a lot of walking and standing.
great for work on concrete all day.
They are great
Love them! Fit true to size. On my feet up to 12 hours a day....very comfortable.
I love it...the shipping was very fast...!
Best shoes I have ever bought. I have arthritis in my feet and they make my feet feel awesome. I would recommend for anyone. I am going to buy another pair in white just to where out.
I bought  two pairs within 3 months because the material  peeled off  the first pair  and I thought my dog  chewed  on them  so I ordered another pair that lasted  only 3mo  the material  peeled off and the soles  unglued  no more skechers for me...........  I should have taken pictures  and sent to the corp.
These shoes run a bit large in size and are extremely heavy.
I needed a pair of leather shoes for school, and these were the cheapest I've seen here. For the price, it really is a steal. Genuine leather, steel toe, which bc makes the shoe a little heavy, nothing drastic, but definitely noticeable. They could be more narrow, but thick socks can help with that. Overall, I'm very happy, well worth the money, very comfortable. However, upon opening the box, the left side of my right shoe, has a very noticeable white scratch mark. And I can't get it out. My shoes are black, and the scratch is white, so it is very noticeable. The only disappointment.
I thought this product might be a little clunky considering the size and steel toe but it's perfect! The memory foam insoles feel great and this product is worth every penny!
Very comfortable shoes for work at an affordable price.  Love the fit & will buy again also recommend these shoes to others!!!!
I ordered a 9.5 in the Skechers for Work Women's Sure Track.  The length is fine, but the I wish they were a little narrower.  They are a liltte too wide.  But I am gonna keep them because I just slip them on when I go out into the plant, I normally stay in the office.
I like them
too big...too wide.
I bought these shoes for  my mother who works in an institutional kitchen near Boston.  She absolutely loves them and is so happy that these shoes are professional work shoes (steel toe) with a patented skid-free sole.  I answered the above review questions based on my mother's comments.<br />The Special deal that Amazon offered on these shoes was an offer I couldn't pass up.
They are non slip as advertised. Size runs a bit large
Good shoes too big
They r so comfortable
I added a gel insole.  These shoes are great.  I am on my feet 12+ hours a day and they are holding up great.
They need a better insole but these shoes are tough I have used them daily for two months now. I work full time at a coffee shop and part time serving at a restaurant so they have a lot of milage already. They have stood up to everything and the shoe is still in great condition three months later.
Feels good. Just a little bigger than my normal shoe size. I would advise getting half a size smaller than your normal shoe size. Otherwise.. Great shoe
Just a tad wider in the toe area than I expected but I think that's gonna work out just fine!  They feel very comfortable. I will definitely buy again
These shoes are surprisingly comfortable it's like walking on a cloud I didn't know they were steel toed i was just buying slip resistant but these are assume.
Have to be on my feet 12 hours a day on hard cement and up and down metal staircases, definitely needed an insole still for the ball of my feet but absolutely the most comfortable pair of work shoes I have bought to date, with the insole it felt like I was walking on air. The medium width is more like a wide but thats ok with me. I usually buy the nautilus brand of shoes and these were so light and flexible in comparison, they felt 'broken in' immediately after I put them on. Will absolutely be ordering another pair in the near future.
Light weight shoe...wide in the toebox
These shoes are bigger in size online than in stores. I was expecting memory foam throughout the whole shoe, only the bottom back half of the shoe has somewhat memory foam. I'm on my feet all day and theres no arch support, I put insoles in them.
I like the look but they are not comfortable at all. My feet were killing me after day one. I put insoles in them and it's a little better
I've been buying Skechers for at least 15 years. Always size 8.  These said they were an eight but we're more than half an inch too big. Felt and looked like clown shoes
I really like my new shoes, they are just a little heavier then the average work shoe. Other than that, they are superior!
Cushion in the heel and arch is fine, but the rest of the insole is very uncomfortable with no cushion whatsoever.  Not very comfortable for someone who is on their feet for 8 or more hours a day.
Wear to work. Like the comfort of the show. Will buy again.
Employee was very pleased with the shoes. They were a great fit and very comfortable.
Wonderful shoes! I've had a pair for about two years now! Unfortunately, they are waring out. It's time to get a new pair. I wear them to work every day. I walk pretty hard on my shoes, these have great support & cushion. Definitely worth the money.
Love these shoes, wide enough an comfortable to be on my feet for my 10 hour shift!!
very very nice just wrong size thank you would love to exchange in for the right side
Exactly what I wanted, ordered and got here fast!
Very Comfortable.
I just worn these today for the first time. They seem to be very comfortable for a steel toed shoe.  I would recommend these, they did not hurt my feet.  Plus these same shoes saved me $30 buying from Amazon verses our work shoe truck!  Thanks Amazon!
PERFECT
wider then expected
no support, very painful to wear. wont buy again.
Really comfy for steel toes.  They feel a little big but it's the toe area and it's just little roomy I would say rather then big. Nothing uncomfortable or anything.
The weight of these shoes almost canceled out the comfort of the memory foam, and took some getting use to. Overall, my feet are comfy and safe. I did order 1/2 a size larger than I normally wear, but they are roomy and protect my feet at work. Never needed a time to &#34;break them in&#34; they were good right out of the box.
Great quality product, fast shipping!!
I wear them all day at work.  Just a tad big.
I have always bought 6.5 on this brand but for this kind were one number bigger. Way too heavy
Great work shoes. Like walking on air
I am very happy with these shoes!  My work as a profesional gardner is extemely demanding on my footwear  -- lots of terrain and pivoting, not to mention mud, wet grass and mulch.  The shoes are perfectly sturdy and yet a little bit &#34;girlie&#34; which I enjoy.
These are the most un uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. I have never had a problem with Skechers before thiS. I do not like these shoes.
Fit good
Good
I havr 3 pairs of these, as i am required to wear safetyl toes for work, and they are the most confortable safety shoes ive ever purchased .
Love them!
I've been wearing sketches for a long time, I ordered the same size and these are way to big. Ordering a different brand, due to not sure what size to get.
I'm a cook and I have to say these shoes are perfect they are so comfortable and are worth every penny
They're really comfortable I'm happy with it.
Not comfortable.  Great for safety but very uncomfortable.
Perfect fit, very comfortable
Too large, trying to return.
they are great  i just wish the memory foam was threw the whole shoe
fast shipping..these are the best that I have ever had..great people to buy from.. thank you for everything
Love these work boots! Memory foam insoles feel great. Fit perfect.
Right foot is o.lk left foot is to big and the steel toe has wore a blisteron top of pinky toe
Nice boots.  They run very big.  I put thick socks on and have a wide foot and still way to large.
The shoe is short. I normally wear a 5.5 but ordered a 6 due to steel toe but it's still a little short BUT if I went bigger, my heel would slip all over as the heel is very loose. May be fine for others since I have a narrow heel.
I like and I'm so happy to have that kind boot for my trip.
Love these
Such good quality shoes! I got these to work in the yard, digging holes for trees, shoveling dirt, etc. Very sturdy shoes. It took a couple of days before my feet got used to the steel toe part; it rubbed a bit on one foot at first, but then all was good as the leather got more used to my feet. Very comfy with the memory foam soles. I would definitely buy again, and the price was the best I could find online for shoes of similar quality.
The insole slips back and forth non stop in these boots. The insole fits, they boot fits slightly small and your foot will slip back and forth. I have purchased separate insoles to use in the boots and that seems to help, it is not as comfortable as memory foam, but at least they stay put. The outside construction of the boot looks good and is very durable. I also really appreciate the sole of the boot and how it is constructed more like a sneaker than a work boot. The interior of the boot leaves so much to be desired. If you do order these, wear them around the house for a while. I didn't notice the insole slipping until I had been working in the mud for several hours.
Excellent
It did not have as much toe room  as I needed.
Super comfie...!!!!  Perfect.
small
I love Sketcher shoes anyway and I am delighted with my new work boots.
The relaxed fit makes my feet slosh around quite a lot. It's not uncomfortable, but a little annoying.
Love it! Though it's not water-proof, but it still helps in the rainy days.
Great fit and looks good.
Loved these boots, they are very attractive and the memory foam insole is ultra comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the steel toe (hated it!), it was fine on the toes, but I could feel the end of the steel plate rubbing against the top of my foot as I walked. I returned them the next day and I'm still looking for this exact boot without the steel toe.
I bought a pair of these at a local shoe depot and got the 6.5. The ended up being too big and my feet slammed into that steel toe. I tried exchanging them for a 6 but couldn't find a pair but loved these boots so much that I ordered them here.<br />The leather is a little stiff the first few minutes after putting them on but after that they are amazing! The memory foam makes a 12 hour shift a breeze. They have so far stood up to anything a barista can throw at them and then some. I slipped in a creek and dunked a whole foot, socks were still dry.<br />I would absolutely recommend these to any hiker, employee, friend and strangers!
they also bother my on my left foot, left me with a bruise.<br />Will try and wear again after my ankle heals up.
Great work boots.  Package doesn't say if they are waterproof but I haven't had any issues cleaning horse stalls, washing horses, walking in mud.  They run a little big and a bit wide, which was fine for me, no breaking in time.  Very comfortable yet light weight, although no arch support.  Can't beat the price - I got last year's model for $27 with prime shipping.
Love the shoes. Fit well. I wear them most of the day, every day and my feet actually stopped hurting after I started wearing these. Thanks skechers.
Really comfortable with the foam soles!! A little bit big but they will work.
Love the memory foam, even though it makes my feet hot. I'm not sure how they will be when it's colder.
Can't beat the price.  Very sturdy and nice looking.
Much more rigid & stiff than expected.  Not what I expected  at all
When it goes on it feels tight but after a few seconds it starts to loosen up.  They're so comfortable and yet tough enough for work.  Right size and perfect fit.
Love them! They are adorable and lightweight. However, I got a 7.5 because I wanted some extra room in the toes (I'm actually a 6.5/7) but it fits just right and my toes touch the top :( It's still comfortable though!
Great shoes.
Great shoes.  Good support Andy grandson looks adorable in them!
This is the 4th year we've bought these shoes for my daughter. She goes to a private charter school and they have a very strict uniform policy. These work well with any of her uniforms! I absolutely love these shoes and will continue to buy them until she cannot fit the sizes anymore! I would go up a half size or so just bc of the narrow-ness of the shoe. I always buy the white pair, but the black are pretty as well.
Purchased for school!
My 8 year old daughter woke me up at 6am Wednesday morning to tell me she needed white shoes for cheerleading on Saturday.  Amazon saved the day once again!  The pictures of these shoes online are not cute.  I was amazed when they got here, because they are super cute!  They look awesome and are perfect for what she needs.
Just what I expected , I'm very happy
I had to return because they were for girls
Good shoe for a good price.
My daughter love this sneakers,fit as expected.
Is really nice and fit as expected
My sister loves the shoes,she says its comfortable.
Bought these for our daughter, great sneaker which she loves but more importantly which provide good support, excellent fit and comfort, just a great product. Worth the few extra $ for the quality and style.
Great product Quick shipping
Great shoe!
Excellent product quality and durability.
my daughter wears them all day long in the school
excellent
A good pair of shoes
My daughter adores these shoes. She loves the silver/glitter accents. They are well made. She is very active and they still look new. Dirt stains can easily be wiped off. Overall these were a great purchase.
Bueno
Very Good!!!
These shoes are very nice and comfortable, I love you !!
My daughter has to have white shoes for school and these are her absolute favorite.  I have been buying them for 3 years now.  Bonus is that they are so easy to put on in the morning rush!
Thanks
This is a gift to my niece. Hopefully she will love them like I do!!! They should arrive to her house in a week. They are going all the way to South America so I'm sure she'll like them.
Cute and durable.
Excellent
good
These shoes were purchased for my daughter. When the weather warmed she wore them two times and the laces broke on one shoe. It looks like the loop was sewn down and the lace wasn't actually through it. Unfortunately it is now too late to return them.
Perfect!
I had a problem whit my asics women gel kinsei 5. It is broken. It was bought in february.  Add a photo. I want to know what hapend in this case.
My daughter has no problem wearing this shoes, she says her friends all like it.
excellent product
excelente
Super comfy and they match any type of outfit. They have a bit of glitter on them so they can be worn with dressy outfits as well as for gym class. Love them!
is expected and recommend the product
just great for school
Perfect!  She loves them! No more boohoo in the am when she puts on her school shoes!
Great shoe! MY DAUGHTER LOVES THEM.
Great shoes for school uniform. They are very comfortable to wear in school all day.
Work perfectly for school uniform with just a little sparkle to make them &#34;girl friendly&#34;!
One of the shoe laces broke after the second time my daughter wore them , but Amazon sent me a replacement. The reason I still give them 4 stars is because she had these same shoes last year and they were good.
Cute shoe but runs very small.  Picture compares the size 11 Nike vs the size 11 Sketcher. Have to hassle with an exchange now.
$38 is too pricy for thsee shoes
My daughter needed plain white shoes for a cheer performance and these were the cheapest I could fine.  Glad I went with them.  They are super cute and she loves the fit.  They fit as expected.  She was just growing out of 12.5 (Stride Rite and Saucony are her other shoes) and these fit perfect with a little room.  She wears almost everyday now.
My daughter goes through 2 pairs of shoes a term! This is the only brand that's rugged and light enough to last any length of time, God buy!
Very durable. My daughter wears them once a week for Physical Education class,  I wash them after every class and after some 25 weeks of washing, they are still in good condition. Would recommend these to any parent.
Nice pair of socks worth it to spend ur money
They didnt spin the way it was posted or at all....you had to look for a very smooth surface to spin the way a dancer would.
My daughter was so excited about these shoes she wants to were them every day
They were perfect until washed? I do not know if Sketchers have went cheap on the the materials but the paint came off and they look very poor after the first wash! I'm not a happy camper. These are one of the most popular kids shoes. As a mother quality trumps fashion!
My daughter loves them! She's says,&#34;They fit perfectly and they are awesome!&#34; She's worn them every day since they've arrived!
I did order my size...Boy say narrow...Extreemly narrow. They were the right length so if i went up a size they would be too long for my foot.Nice boot..I would have kept them but they werent sized right. So I went to return them and I have to pay for the postage.!! Thats just not right.
she loves them!
A little big... but no worries.
Bought this product at the store for about the same price. My daughter won't take them off. Fit is perfect and fabric is soft so there is no rubbing or discomfort without socks. Has nice memory foam inside. Worth every penny.
Exactly as expected
Love them match everything
Daughter loves these shoes.  She wears them with everything
Beat up after three wears!
Perfect shoes! My daughter won't take them off! Great buy!
Cute shoe!  No longer available in the stores.
61 years of age and size 3 in kids shoes. I am just gettin ready to buy a few more pairs so if they ever discontinue them, I'm ready!
My daughter loves them.. fit great ..very cute
thanks love them
My daughter loves these shoes and can wear them all day.
These shoes are cute and my 3 year-old daughter loves them but they do seem to run a little bit on the long side.
Great shoe...granddaughter loved them!
Nice comfy insole, nicely made, but wide and kind of floppy on the foot.
My daughter loves them.
I bought them for my niece as a &#34;thank you for watching my rambunctious kids&#34; gift, and she LOVES them! She wears them every day and all day.
Great shoes very light.
This sneaker is beautiful and very lightweight and the fact that there are no shoe laces was a must for my 9 year old... BUT the sizing is huge!!! This sneaker in a girl's size 5 is at least half a size (if not a full size) bigger than my women's 6.5 skechers go walks!!!! I had to put them away and give my daughter my sneakers to wear to school. These will have to wait for a couple of years.
VERY GOOD was what I expected.
Great shoes for my daughter!!
is expected and recommend the product
good
Good quality
So glad skechers makes go walks for kids - wish they made them for toddlers too. I get a pair for my niece every year for her birthday and she looks forward to them each year, they are so comfy and easy for kids to put on. These are her go to shoes, she wears them out. This paint splash design is so cute as well. Love them.
My particular little girls LOVES them!
My daughter loves these shoes!  She has a narrow foot so finding a slip on is tricky.  These are perfect.
Bought these for my granddaughter. The colors are bright and they are lightweight. She has a bit of a wide foot and they fit perfectlyl. She has been wearing them for about 4 months and they're still holding up. Great shoe!
My daughter loves these. She said they are the most comfortable athletic shoes she has ever worn.
Very good
My daughter loves these shoes.  Nice fit and quality.
These are super cute. I really love the way they look on my daughter and she loves how they fit. Not a bulky shoe and bendy. The rainbow print goes with everything. Would totally buy again.
My daughter loves these shoes!  They were a little big for size, but nothing some cheap insoles couldn't fix!  The colors at nice and bright as well.
The shoe was too small, returned and havent replaced it with a larger size. Cant say much about the shoe since she didnt didnt fit in it, but she seemed to really like the style and it was very light weight.
Good shoes
My little girl fit these just right.  She loves them.
These are cute and exactly what my daughter loves.  They seem to fit as described and she can wear them all day at daycare with no blisters.
Great quality product but they're a little too big.
My little girl just love the shoes.  Planning to order another pair for her soon
I bought these for my 7 year old and she ran through them pretty quick this was her second pair she loved the first pair so much i bough her another pair but they barley made it 2 weeks if that she wore her original pair for like 2-3 months.  i dont know what happen.
Lots of compliments on the snazzy colors.  Light as a feather, but decent support
Bought these for my daughter.  Really needed an 10.5 but I think this will do as long as she wears with socks for awhile.  Love the colors.
My step daughter's favorite summer shoe.  Many compliments on these.
Love the shoe
like
My daughter loves these shoes.  She is very comfortable.
My daughter has narrow feet and it is always hard finding narrow shoes (other than Keds).  These shoes fit her feet well and we can tighten them on her narrow feet without the velcro being so pulled over that it hangs to the ground.  She has said that they are comfortable to wear and they are very lightweight.
Thanks...
I bought these for granddaughter. I cannot personaaly answer questions on fit and comfort, but she loves them.
Adorable, comfy shoes! Got as expected.
gorgeous
The strap on the side has a very weak Velcro for kids..<br />I am disappointed.
My 7 year old got them in her Easter basket... loved them!
Good shoes. Hope they hold up. Little kids can be hard on shoes.
boutht it for my daughter. good price and quality. lightweight.
My daughter adores these sneakers. Well made; they feel like they will hold up to an active 6 year old. The colors are very bright, but attractive. They are comfortable and seem true to size or possibly a bit larger than the other shoes she has this size.
this is my kids regualar wear to school. i love sketchers brand
My daughter loved them!
Super disappointed. I think this is the first time I've actually bothered to do a review, but I'm so bummed about these shoes I felt like I needed to write about them. We just got these shoes TODAY, and after wearing for all of ten minutes, the shoes are getting destroyed. I realize kids can be rough on shoes, but I'd expect them to hold up a little better and although they (were) super cute, I'm very disappointed in the quality.
My daughter loves these! She also loves the bright colors and the easy on velcro. No complaints so far.
my daughter loves these - super comfy
This shoes are fabulous. It enchanted to my daughter and are very comfortable.
Great true fit. Love the shoe and the price.
Love them!!!!!
excelente
Everything good!
Looks really nice and fits very well. The size chart was very helpful. Super happy
Great for summer wear to school. She loved them
Second pair of sketchers I bought for my 6 year old. She grew out of the 1st and they still look brand new. She loves them.
My granddaughter loved them!!!
Looked cute.  Bows fell off in the first week, they are held on by double sided tape:-(
Excelent
really cute! well made and durable.
The bows fell off the first week but good rain boots.
Loved them! Bought other brand at beginning of school year and heal already had worn through in a month! Big hole wet feet.... but theses Skechers boots have nice thick soles and, a better fit :)
My 5yo daughter loves them as she has all her other Velcro Light-up sketchers. I was worried they may appear too boyish due to the camo, but the straps are very pink and sparkly gold- much more so than the pic. I told her the squirrels and lizards would like the camo and she really likes that notion:)
Excellent!
My daughter loves them. She says she will never wear another shirt
They run a little bit small
Grandaughter says that they are very comfortable.
Love these little shoes. They are comfortable but cute. I introduced my granddaughter to Skechers walking shoes and she is in love. Previously twinkle toes were her favorite so I decided to try these. Definitely will buy again...just wish they were cheaper
She loves them!
Quick shipping and great items- thanks!
Great sneaker, perfect fit. Shipped fast.
Great for a little extra support.  My 9 yo loves them.
Only brand and type of shoe we will buy. Great support and comfort. Great ventilation. A+ active sneakers.
My daughter has pain in her feet and shins when she wears these shoes for very long.
perfectos!!
My daughter loves them and they are so durable and fit great.
Love these! Bought them as play shoes for my daughter. She says they are comfortable and the grey hides dirt well. Can't go wrong when they are under $20 :-)
This shoes look even better in person. They are perfect for spring and summer time with the cheery colors. My daughter thinks these shoes are so comfortable with the memory foam.
Good Shoe
Great
I have a very petite 7 year old who still wears a size 10/11 toddler shoe.  It is so hard to find properly fitting, well made and durable soccer cleats for a child of her size. I spent quite a few hours browsing online trying to hunt down shoes that 1. Came in her specific size, and 2. Were from a reliable brand so that I knew they would hold up.<br /><br />* These shoes easily slip on over soccer socks, with a dip low enough under ankles that they do not rub against shin guards.<br />* Once laced, these shoes have zero issues staying tied.<br /><br />We have used the same pair of cleats for 2 soccer seasons now and they have held up well without falling apart, scuffing terribly or having the cleats rub and wear down.  I will happily buy the next size up in this brand for my daughter once she grows.
My daughter loves them!
Daughter loves them!
Super cute.  Daughter loves them!
Very cute and my 7yo daughter loved the colors but they were too small even though we ordered her regular size
Perfect fit and my daughter loves them...true to size
My daughter loves them
My 5 year old daughter loves her soccer shoes and wants to wear them everywhere.  She never complains about discomfort with these cleats.  The colors are very appealing to my little girl and she runs and runs in them.  After several practices and games the shoes still look good and she is happy.
My daughter loves these!
Great product for a great price.
My daughter loves these and I could only find her size online. She love that you can turn the lights on and off with a button. I did have to order one size up she has a wide foot but then it fit her perfect.
Gorgeous. My daughter loved it. It has a memory foam sole which I make it very comfortable for school and long walks.
great shoe. very cute, however the very first day she wore the shoe 3 of the little silver sparklers fell off the toe of one shoe. None have fallen off since, so I suspect it was an odd defect with that shoe. But she really likes them and says they are comfortable.
excellent
My daughter loves these shoes!
I bought these shoes for my daughter because she needed a new pair while we were on vacation. The fit was perfect, gave her really good support, and were not clunky. My daughter goes through shoes faster than most kids because she has a disability that affects her left foot, leg, and the way she walks. These shoes have held up really well. She receives a lot of compliments on the funky style too. I love that they light up. The only thing that annoyed me a little bit is the tongue of the shoe. As you can see, it hangs over the top as part of the style. It doesn't always stay where it is supposed to though and after a couple of weeks, we just cut it down so that it didn't hang over anymore. This is a great shoe.
These are labeled as sketchers twinkle toes sneakers but they don't light up!  Not sure if I got a bad pair or if that is the case with all of the sweet n savy sketchers but my 5 year old was not amused when they didn't work like the ones she outgrew.  I am returning them.
My granddaughter loved her shoes.  They were perfect but she can't wear them at practice because they might get muddy!
My daughter just loved her twinkle toes! Just as expected.
My Daughter loves them!
Sizing seems different from same size Skechers tennis shoes.
Got these for my 7 year old.  They are CRAZY rigid.  Not fit for long walks or school. They are really cute and quite an eye-catcher, but not a great buy for an active kid or growing feet.  Save your money and get some cute New Balance or Asics.
Purchased these for our granddaughters birthday and she loved them.  She is a girly girl which loves pink, glitter and sparkle, but most of all they light up which was her first request!
Grandaughter loves them
Bright them as a gift for my 5 year old great niece and she absolutely loves them.
My daughter love them soooo much !<br />I do too ,really cute ,little Rock style<br />Nothing wrong except for sure they will lost the rhinestone and the light won't work after few month or depend how your kid wear and play with them ...but this is the way with any shoes No ?
Its fine.
Super Cute! My princess loves them. They go with both pants and jean skirts for the warmer weather. We love Skechers.
So cute ! My daughter loved them !
My daughter loves these shoes and they are cute but I don't particularly care for the width of the shoe and lack of support it gives.
My daughter loves them and cuter in person.  Price was awesome!!! She wears a 1 1/2 and they fit her perfectly!
Great price, speedy shipping.
This was for my 6yr. old daughter. This is definitely a girlie girl shoe.....at a great price.
Originally purchased to complete a costume for a play, I like that they're something my daughter can wear day-to-day as well, and she adores them. I bought them a bit large so they might last through this Fall/Winter season; so far, no rubbing or discomfort!
Love them.
Unfortunately, the shoe was too small to measure, what to do now?
Really like these because the insert can be removed.  I get tired of wearing sports shoes for comfort, I have RA, and these do the trick.
These are fabulous shoes. I wear them all day and night when I go out. I dance in them. They have great<br />cushioning, and they are very comfortable. After I had worn these shoes for a couple of weeks, I got back online to order another pair just like it.
Very soft and light weight! I would expect them to be a little less expensive, but I guess you pay the price for comfort! I have high arches so I have to put an arch support, but thankfully there is room in the shoe for that.
Exactly what I wanted. Fast ship and delivery. Very pleased!
Not the most attractive shoe. I returned them.
Second pair of these--most comfortable shoes I own!  Definitely fit for bare feet.
product received as requested.
too flimsy
I've worn many different brand of tennis shoes (Reebok, DKNY, Danskin, New Balance, etc.)  None of them give me the comfort of these shoes.  I am 63 years of age and I can wear these shoes all day long and have complete comfort.  They are amazing.  But they are fabric, so I don't expect they will last a long time.  They are already looking a little &#34;worn' but not too bad.  I suspect I will have to replace them every year.  It's worth it.  I'm happy they have white soles for sailing.  Over all, I give this shoe a &#34;ten.&#34;  These are my favorite shoes and I wear them every single day.  I have ordered both black and navy.
Comfortable and cute
I love Skechers
I would have liked it in an 8 wide but they work - because of bunions. The are smart casual; great for fun or an 8 hr. work day.
These are the best shoes ever.  I bought another pair in another color.  They will allow me to walk all day where as other shoes cause my feet to hurt.  I will probably end up buying another pair.
The shoes are light and comfortable to wear all day long. However, the real color is a little bit different from shown in picture.
Thanks
My wife is very happy, fits amazing
Very tight I would go up 1/2 size otherwise very comfortable
product too tight around the arch
I had to send them back and it cost $18ðŸ˜’<br />They run small!
I love the support that Skechers givr
I like them but one slips off heel and the other one is too tight. Very close cushy shoe.
I have a lot of skechers shoes and these are so comfortable and did not disappoint! The cushy insoles make walking in them all day so comfy. I usually wear between and 9.5 and a 10 in shoes. I got these in a 9.5 and at first I thought they were way too small. I had to really pull them on me the first time, and initially I assumed I had to return them for a size 10. But once I put them on, they fit like a glove and the 9.5 was perfect.<br /><br />If you go between two half sizes just keep in mind that they may be slightly snug in the lower size. If you like to slip on a shoe very easily then go for the half size larger. Obviously, this is only if you fit between two half sizes (ie 9.5 and 10).  You do NOT need to size up a full size on this shoe. It does run true to size. I was just giving info for people who debate between two half sizes.<br /><br />There is not much more I can say about these shoes except to say that they keep my feet happy all day. They do look a bit clunky. Obviously, this is more of a no frills functional shoe. If you want a more feminine shoe, check out some of skechers other go walk shoes that have splashes of other color. But if you want comfort and simplicity, then I highly recommend this shoe!
I love this shoe. I have been dealing with a heel spur and theses shoes are the most comfortable shoe that I can wear by far.
This is my second pair of Go Meb shoes, because I love how they make my feet feel, including during my runs.
I am very happy with these shoes.  I think they are just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Cons:<br />#1 - They do run a bit narrow and shorter than the other Sketcher's I have purchased.  I have been buying my running shoes about a half size larger and it has worked well for me but these probably need to be a full size larger.  In spite of this, I can tie them comfortably with the longer size shoe strings and keep my toes from hitting the end of the shoe.<br />#2 - They are not nearly as cushioned as the GoRun series.  I have not tried the GoRide series.  I have run 14 miles in them.  My feet are feeling tired today (day after two days of running) and a bit sore on the bottom.  I believe I have gotten accustomed to more padding but didn't realize until using these shoes.  I believe this will be fine as I continue to use them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />I knew there was a possibility of the cons above before purchasing.  But the pros made it worth it to me.<br />#1 - The weight, the shoes feel very nice.  Not so light that you feel unprotected but not heavy at all.<br />#2 - The build, they continue the Sketcher trend of providing very good quality for a very reasonable price.  I was skeptical at first but Sketchers is proving that they are serious about performance shoes. The shoes are a great minimalist shoe and allow you to have good foot strike over a long term.<br /><br />I do recommend these shoes but would caution you to transition into them just like you should with any new running shoe - a few miles at a time.
Narrow in midfoot keeps my foot snug but wide enough at toes to be comfortable. Very light, very fast.
ultra light great for 10-21K, maybe 42K if feeling like running on the edge. great toe box.
Not as good as the original Go Speed, but I have run marathons in this model without socks with no problems .
Excellent fit! Sorry about previous review. It wasnt for this item
Good
Great lightweight running shoes
I have decided to work toward a 0-drop running shoe, so this has a 4mm drop (while typical running shoes have 6-8mm. This is comfortable and I have been able to run up to 6 miles so far with no pain or discomfort. Some minimalist shoes have minimal cushion, so I am pleased with the cushion this provides for distance running.
Cute shoes
Perfect shoes, so bad Skechers decided to change the model, this one is the perfect to run!
Only complaint is that they will not last long. As long as I can find them for around $60 it is a worthwhile tradeoff.
A great running shoe! After years of Asics Gel Pulse and KSwiss, it was a great and surprising find of the Skecher Go Run 4's. Comfortable and light with decent arch support, the shoe ticks all the right check boxes. I didn't read otherwise, so I'm guessing that this is a neutral gait shoe and not one for motion control (for over/under pronation). Perhaps the best thing about these is the price point, coming it at $40 - $50 less than most Asics trainers.
Very comfy shoe,great bright colors. A little  over priced.
Love the colors!
Love them
I can't be sure of how good the arch supports are since I wear Strutz (arch supports) inside my shoes. The shoes are very light weight, so you barely feel them on. I was hoping they would be comfortable for my bunions, but I still have some discomfort wearing them; this is not the shoes fault!
I am a Nike gal but with all the running I do Nike wasn't cutting it anymore due to their lack of cushioning. My feet hurt so much my doctor had to prescribe me pain/anti-inflammatory medicine. I tried on lots of shoes and the Sketchers Go Run Bolt were perfect. I wasn't happy that it didn't come in an 8.5 to allow room for my feet to swell (which feet do when you exercise) and 9's were too big but because the fabric stretches and breathes it didn't bother me once I broke them in. I have had them for a few months now and they are still holding up.
Great for walking
The bottom red x & one of the dots came off on one shoe after 3rd wear. usually skechers last forever, but i was highly disappointed that these fell apart so soon. i have about 150 pairs & this is my 1st casualty
Very comfortable!
Very comfortable
Got these for my girl. They fit perfectly. Look good. And are very comfortable.
I got this type because I had a prior pair but this type was really snug in the toe area. I wore them all day and by the end of the day I could tell I would not be wearing these shoes anymore. I gave them away to my daughter in law otherwise I would have sent them back.
Loved the look!  Very nice looking shoes but ran a little small.  I could have kept them but I decided to return them and go to Skechers store to get a pair that fit better.  I love my GoWalk shoes from Skechers and ordered the same size but these ran smaller!
Great
They are comfortable shoes...like them a lot.
Love these shoes! they are so comfortable! love the look too!
Son loves it. He's a runner.
There is a very unusual &#34;hump&#34; in the arch area that made these very uncomfortable. (I have high arches and I like good arch support however this was not what I consider to be arch support) The shoe it's self was a little larger than my usual size 12 running shoe. I like to keep about a thumbs width in front of my big toe but these were a little longer. The shoe has a &#34;u&#34; shaped sole that's purpose is to help &#34;rock&#34; your foot as you strike the ground. However, I am a heel striker and this caused a very uncomfortable and unusual change in my gate that cause calf pain almost instantly. I didn't care for these and have switched to the Hoka Clifton 2 to try.
Best fit and very comfortable!
I love at
Only worn them twice. Seem very nice. Excellent shock absorption. Fit is right on for size 13.
Amazing cushion and still light enough to race in.
Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. They feel like you are wearing pillows on your feet and yet they still provide great support. Super lightweight and just feel good. I will buy more of them when I need new ones.
Size not accurate
Groovy shoes for the paws.
Extremely comfortable.  Buy,buy,buy.
Simply the best shoe out there for runners with back problems.  Hoka's are possibly similar but cost more and frankly they look odd.  Skechers' mid-foot strike shoes are a god send and the highly cushioned Ultra 2 are great for long runs in particular as they combine relatively light weight (under 10oz) for the cushioning provided and are quite flexible.  Toe box is wide which most of us &#34;older&#34; runners need.  I have high arches and find that I don't need to use orthotics or Spenco arch cushions in this shoe.  For 5k/10k racing I would recommend one of Skechers' &#34;Ride&#34; or &#34;Meb&#34; models.
Perfect, best shoes ive ever bought
I was excited about these thinking they would be a more comfortable version of Van's slip-ons but was disappointed to find them very narrow and a little small. I always wear a 7.5 in Skechers slip-ons but these were definitely too small and especially narrow. The dealbreaker was the fabric upper. It's made of stretchy fabric like water shoes that stretches as you walk. You could see the outline of my toes and the shoes did not stay in place on my foot. It felt like when you're wearing wet tennis shoes in water and they flop against the bottom of your foot because they are soggy. Definitely returning these.
These are very comfortable and reasonably cute, but do not breathe at all. I do not recommend these for hot weather or long distances. ðŸ˜•
Shoes are feather light and true to size. Great for amusement park walking.
Perfect to slip on for running around on errands all day. Look good with jeans, crop pants or shorts. Sporty and casual. Love the navy blue denim look. Very little arch support, but not needed so no problem there.
Great slip on for spring and summer.  I wear a 6 or 6.6 depending on shoe style and brand.  Because it is flat, stretchy and I don't wear with sock, the 6 is the way to go for me.  Don't make my feet too sweaty or stinky which is always a concern when wearing shoes without socks.
I love these shoes. I have slightly high arches, so they don't provide complete support for me. However, I have no problem wearing them all day. I am sure the arch support is fine for the average arches, that is why I said yes to good arch support. Very comfortable. I am sure I will end up buying more in other colors eventually. I have also had several compliments on how cute they are and have been asked where I got them. You really cannot go wrong with these.
They were a little small I would recommend going a half size up if you're unsure. I thought these were the same shoes I had tried on in Kohl's but when I ordered these the sole was different. They are not gel padded memory foam like I expected them to be like some of the other styles of Skechers shoes. That was a little disappointing because I was looking forward to the gel padding, but they are still comfortable and have some padding.
These shoes are so comfy! They have substantial cushioning for being a casual slip on shoe. I broke my ankle last summer and had to have surgery. I have a plate and screws in my ankle now, and I have been unable to wear a lot of my older shoes because they were flats and/or had no support. These are cute, and they fit the comfort bill for me. I can wear these to run errands and chase after my two year old much more comfortably.
Wore them for 4 days in a row while camping in the desert and were comfortable.
They are so comfortable and stylish I wear them with jeans everything I have different colors
Sketchers Go...need I say more?  This is my third pair of the Sketchers Go products.  I LOVE THEM!  I wear them all day at work (standing most of the day)  Wore for 3 days straight in Orlando at Universal Studios.  Wore on all the water rides and they dried up fast.  Bought this latest pair as i need a good pair of walking shoes for Europe and do not want to wear running shoes.  Will buy again!  These are true to size, which is why I have no problem buying them online.  I know they will fit great!
Comfortable and washes easily in the washing machine.
Great shoes!
I prefer the original Go Walk, (Cadence?) but this is very close. Comfortable and wears well.
I LOVE these!  The little bit of elastic on the throat makes them so much more comfortable over my high instep than the similar design without the elastic.  In most sneakers, I wear a size 9 but since I don't plan to wear socks with these, I ordered the 8.5 and they fit beautifully.
I'm disappointed. I wear a 9.5 in every Skechers I've ever had so I thought I'd be fine ordering this new style online. Wrong. They ran big, these feel more like a size 10. And what's with the hard inside bottom of the show (what your foot contacts)? It feels like hard plastic.
Love love love these shoes for work. On my feet all day. Have 3 pairs so I can rotate them.
I have five pairs.  And love them, this aqua color is adorable
good product , great service
It is difficult to find shoes that are comfortable for me, so I was disappointed that the design is different than the ones I previously purchased, making them stiffer.  I am hopeful that they will soften after wearing them without causing too many blisters for my heels while &#34;breaking them in&#34;.  I believe that the original design was a popular one, therefore I don't understand why that design needed changing.
&#34;Go walk icon&#34; has a very different  insole from Go walk 2 and I find Go Walk ICON to be MUCH more comfortable and incredibly light weight. They conform to your foot, not just mine, like a softer airier memory foam.  They dry quickly and are easy to wash. I love the canvas and cushy insole.  I hope there will be more available in the near future.    I  would buy one of  everything Skechers made if they would only make a more classic style shoe. Like these canvas ones or a more classic style dress shoe. That means no frills or cut outs or bling or bulky stitching. Just classic black.
I've been wearing these pretty much ever since I received them in the mail.  I really like them and will order more.
Shoes to live in. So comfortable. I ordered another pair.
Excellent service from seller and the shoes are perfect ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘
My wife loves her new shoes.
Bought for someone else who said:<br /><br />I have 10 pairs of skechers because they're just the most comfortable pair of shoes to wear! I work 12 hour shifts at a hospital so I'm on my feet a lot. I also have flat feet so it's hard to find comfortable shoes without much of an arch. I wear this particular pair out with jeans. I have other styles that are for work only.
I LOVE these shoes. I've been walking on my lunch break daily and my Skechers deLites from a few years ago are just DONE. My knees and calves were hurting after just short distances because of the lack of support. These provide great support for my high arches, and I can walk the full 2-mile path on my break now in total comfort. The color is super cute, especially with the bright laces to give the lovely blue an extra pop. I want to buy about 3 more pairs of these so I can keep them at home, at work, in my car, at my parents' place... I just need to decide whether to get this great color again or try some of the other cute combinations!
So comfortable!  Looks pretty cool for Skechers.  I usually don't like the brand or styles they make but these look cool and are light weight and so comfy I feel like I can walk/stand all day in them.
Expensive for flip flops but worth it and your feet will thank you. Wore to Disneyland and my feet never complained. In regular flip flops they were ready to fall off! Will be buying more of these and throwing out my others.
Love them
great
was very happy with them thank you
These are so comfortable & work perfectly on my daily walks!
Second pair of the GO WALK cancer shoe. Very comfortable
I love them. They are so light and comfortable.
These shoes are very comfortable and I wear them a lot and have had no issues with the.
Great shoe -- good for all purposes
Have many.many pairs of skeetchers in all different colors.  wear them everyday .to work.  walking  the dog etc..
LOVE the colors! I want to buy another pair of the skechers trilogy but can not find my size. Please make more!!!!!!!
AWESOME
I love Skechers, these are so comfortable and light on your feet. I would not hesitate to advise anyone male or female not to own one of these. Brilliant on your feet and im going to take them on holiday.
I love them. They are so comfortable.
very good
I need 39 exactly
I will be returning them they are huge on my feet!  They dont fit like my go walk originals do.
Was expecting GoGa mat insoles but these do not have that feature.  They are good running shoes, nice and light with excellent air movement!
This was my second pair of GO Run Ride 3's I like the fabric upper but it wasn't a decisive issue for me either way. When I'm running, they feel just like the regular GRR3's - which is just as I expected.
Very comfortable.  Good price.  I continue to go with Skechers over Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc.  I trust the shoes so there's no need to risk trying any other brand.
A+
I liked the shoes, but they were defective, so I sent them back. I will most likely order them again, and hope they are ok, this time.
Great walking shoe..the most comfortable I've ever worn..especially with the second inner cushion that comes with a new pair.
Not great for running, however they are an extremely comfortable walking shoe.
My favorite shoes. Cool in summer. Fast service.
the shoes looks good and very comfortable. Light weight and easy to fit on. The menu says that it can deal with extreme weather as described, I am looking forward to have a try. Overall, I like it.
Cheap quality. i like sketchers in general. buy sperry in these for good quality
Satisfied!
Super comfortable no socks
Ran true to size and VERY comfortable
These shoes were replacements for ones that were worn out.<br />They are very comfortable and will purchase additional ones when available.
Picky husband loves these. Jersey material though, so don't get your feet wet. Shipped in allotted time. Got a 9 1/2 And he wears a 9 1/2.  Orange is nice and muted. Good looking shoe.
the inside seams around the top mid to lower toe area are very rough and irritated my feel when I tried them on. I could not wear them.
Excelent, thanks
I gotta say, I'm a SKECHERS person now! Most comfortable sneakers ever! I actually forgot I still had them on a few times! I review products to help others as they have helped me! I bought a 7&1/2. When I first put them on, I thought I should've went a size smaller. I think you just have to get used to them because there perfect  now! Maybe it's the memory foam? I love these so much that I'm buying another pair for back up!
This is my second pair of these. Love them, thus the second pair. Shipping was fast!!
I have been a Skechers fan for years, and they have not disappointed me yet! I had a Achilles' tendon surgery incision on the inside instep, and the sneaker clogs were a perfect comfort fit during my healing process. The memory form gave me the right type of cushion, and support I need for the healing, and the clog is perfect in order to not aggravate the incision while it heals.  Thanks again Skechers for a great product!
I wish I had ordered a second pair in another color. So comfy and light weight. Get them!!! You won't regret it.  And don't forget to but that second pair.  KH
The shoe is a bit larger than  previous size 5s that I have purchased in the past.  Comfortable with ankle socks.
After wearing these only a few times, the memory foam is no longer providing support and these are useless without new insoles as they have no other support.  For $10 these might be worth it, but for for $34?  Absolutely not.  Skechers, I expected much more from you.
Would have love the shoes but to big.  Liked them so much order a smaller size.
I first bought these when I was on a trip and needed something other than flip flops to walk in, and these are the most comfortable shoes - I wear them everywhere. My feet don't hurt at the end of the day.
These sneakers were just too stiff for me. I like a flexible, moving shoe. I returned them.
LOOK GREAT, FEEL GREAT, CAN WEAR ALL DAY. GREAT LOOKING. THANK YOU
Nice, comfortable shoes! They arrived quickly & they fit perfectly.
I love them and am telling my friends about them!!!
I only wear Skechers and I did as most of the comments suggested, and bought a 1/2 size smaller than usual. They fit length wise but the fabric on top made them feel huge. I wore them in the house from one room to the next and felt like I had to scrunch my toes to hold them on. I wish they made them like the older  models that had leather uppers with laces. Even the ones w/o laces give more of a snug fit that you need especially w/o backs.The fabric makes a loose sloppy fit.
Use them at home since I am a homemaker now and run around the house all day. I was told by my podiatrist I need extra support on my feet since I have flat feet. They are sooo light. Really good buy. Need to get another set!
Love. So comfy.
My 2nd pair....Love them!!
I ordered these to replace another pair returned as they were too small.  Unfortunately, I was called out of the country 3 days before the shoes arrived.  I have yet to try them on.  But I believe they will be fine.  I love how skechers lets their customers know how a particular style is fitting.  It will be another two months before I am back to wear them and it will be too late to return them.  Brand new in the box, they will re-sell easily or make a great gift for my daughter.
No more hurting & burning feet
Love these shoes..
I had an ankle injury in 1990 and my ankle hurts EVERY day. These shoes have come the closest to comfort for me. I will buy some more of them.
perfect fit.  just as nice looking in person.  I'm considering buying another pair.
I've been searching for a slip on, white, comfortable pair of sneakers since last summer! I went with my normal brand. I've had back problems for over 10 years. I won't say the name but I actually got to the point of settling. Lesson learned! WOW!!! They are so comfortable and lightweight. The memory foam? Unbelievable! I'm actually going to buy another pair as another user did!! For the price and quality? I'm happy!
Nice slide on. To large sent them back. May order again at a later time at a size smaller.
It''s not the shoe...which was very nice. They just run very big. I looked at my other shoes like this style of a different brand and they were size 8 so I ordered size 8. My foot swam in them. I probably could have used a size 7 and I normally wear a 7 1/2. But in open backed shoes I usually get a 1/2 size bigger. I say order a 1/2 size smaller at least. And they are wider than most shoes also. But it as a nice shoe and I was disappointed.
I love the shoes.  I have 2 pairs and this would have been my 3rd. I  am returning them because I ordered 1/2 size to big...my fault.  I other 2 pairs are a size 8 and I mistakenly  ordered 8 1/2 . I THINK THIS STYLE MIGHT RUN A BIT LARGE BECAUSE MY normal size is 8 1/2.
luv the shoes
Not bad, but not as comfortable as another pair I have had in the past.  A little disappointed.
Love the slip ons and these are great.
I bought them for my Mom, who has a smaller foot than me. However, I kept them because they fit me perfectly and I normally wear a size 9. Very comfy.
They are perfect, just a little bit on the big side.
I liked these shoes so much I ordered the white ones also.
My feet slide around when I walk in the shoes
Skechers never disappoint and this style lives up to that expectation. Extremely comfortable with the Skechers support we all expect. Would purchase again.
Attractive style and mostly comfortable.  I will have to either wear heavier socks or use an insert due to size issues.  The shoes also seemed a little overpriced since they are immitation leather and cloth.  Still I like the style enough to deal with these issues.  I do wish that smaller sizes were not so hard to find.  I'm not sure about further purchases and will wait to see how durable these shoes are.  The delivery was very prompt and I appreciate this.
Always Love my SKETCHERS
Comfortable but not good for prolong wear. Not good for high arch. Lower back and knees hurt during long walks (10 hours ). Maybe will be good for short term walks.
I love these shoes but I need more cushion on the bottom because I have plantar fascitis and got a job where I need to stand 8 hrs a day.  They have no strings to tie together but the strings pull together and keep the shoes on comfortably.  I'm very picky about shoes and even though I have wide feet, these shoes fit great and are lightweight which I love.  However the shoe inserts have no cushion to them, so I was going to put inserts in there but then it makes the shoe tighter.  If you don't have problem feet like I do then you won't have an issue with the inserts but I need more cushion on the soles or I will die from the pain.
Comfy like a marshmallow!!! Love these!
Fits well a size smaller the normal. I'm an 11 and 10 is super comfy, but I would not recommend as a water shoe. As soon as water touches the shoes they get so slippery it will knock you off your feet if you have bad balance!
Haven't worn them yet, but trying them on they seem good.  Like that they can be hosed off after wearing in mud, etc.
These shoes are amazing! I purchased them for my upcoming Hawaii vacation and I can not wait to snorkel with these bad boys. It's so hard to find fashionable, comfortable water shoes that are not crazy overpriced. If you're even thinking about buying these do it!You can not beat the price of these shoes.
I love these shoes! I also have them in gray and probably will purchase them in other colors.<br />I do a lot of walking and these shoes are great for that . They are very very comfortable!
This is a very comfortable water shoe.
Great shoes..and very light to wear...
The reviews I read said they ran large.  I thought that meant in length--not.  I ordered 1/2 size smaller and they are the right length but they are way too wide.  I have trouble keeping them on my feet.  I will keep them to wear on the beach.
These shoes run big. I wear 8 1/2 and was recommended to buy nine because they didn't have 1/2 sizes. NO, to large go down to an 8. Bought to wear at beach so will see how they are next week. I am a big Sketchers fan.
Cut too short
Cute, comfortable, and breathable. Fits true to size.
Great comfortable walkable all day shoes. Enjoy!
I use these for water aerobics classes and when we get into the high intensity moves, the shoes slip out a bit from the back.  I wish they fit a little snugger so that they didn't slip around so much when being used in water.
I cannot believe these are water shoes!! These are so light and cute that I could easily where them all day anywhere. Those of you heading to water parks, the lake, the pool....you are in for a treat if you get these!!! WOW!! Love them!
It is really comfortable beyond my expectation, highly recommended.
These H2 go shoes run large so i ordered a size smaller. I have a wide foot and all the H2 go shoes are really comfortable and great all around walking shoes. They are almost like a tempura pedic bed. They support all parts of your foot. I just love them and have several pair.
Very nice summertime shoes!  Comfortable!  Love them!
I like these shoes for watering my garden but I was amazed other buyers say they run large. I bought the black with pink soles and I bought my regular size. They are about a half size too small. I am keeping them since I don't have to wear them long. I want another pair but now I don't know what size to buy since apparently some run large.
Amazing comfort.I don't want to take these shoes off.Fit like a glove. They DO NOT lose their shape.
I LOVE SKETCHERS!!!!!!!!!  Best shoe I have ever worn and the shoe types cover the gambit from atheltic to Oxfords!!  SKETCHERS are the only shoes I own!!<br /><br />Phil Taber
Difficult to break in and a little narrow compared to the shoes I normally buy in the same size and style.  Leather is very hard and unforgiving.  Memory foam is ok but no better than you would get in most other shoes without it.
Great shoe so far for the price.  I've worn them two days at work with no break-in required.  I took an older pair to the office just in case they started to hurt or rub, but I forgot about them and was comfortable all day.  For the price I paid, I've been pleasantly surprised.  If they hold up for a couple of months, it will be a great investment.  Thanks, Skechers for a great product and a great price!
Very good, I bought 3 years ago and still new and has a good confer I will definitely recommend
Sturdy and perfect for those snowy days.
Excelent.
my son loved them
Be aware these are not Men's Speedees Drifterz, I ordered men's size 7 and received infant/toddler size 7. They are simply categorized and labeled improperly. My son has these in another color and loves them, they are good shoes just not the right size.
Absolutely sent me a baby shoe and not a men's shoe. I actually looked at the drop-down menu and figured that the sizes listed after &#34;Toddler&#34; and &#34;Little Kid&#34; would be big kid sizes, but they're infant sizes. I ordered a &#34;Men's Speedeez Drifterz Navy/Blue US 7M&#34; and got baby shoes. The bar code on the shoebox says men's. It is obviously not.
The shoes are way to hard to get on. Too small.
Purchased these shoes for my son for beginning of school in Sept 2014.  By November, the threads had separated at the top of the toe and there was a hole on one of the shoes.  He wore these shoes maybe twice or three times a week since we have a few other pair of shoes.  We usually wear Stride Rite but the lure of the &#34;Magic Lites&#34; had my son hooked from the first commercial.  We contacted Skechers, and was sent a new pair of shoes in December.  In February, noticed the frayed threading, and here we are again with two holes in the shoe at the toe.  I am very disappointed in Skechers Magic Lites.  I am trying a different Skechers shoe, and if this one tears apart within two months, I'm going back to Stride Rite or will try another brand!!!  #nothappywithSkechersrightnow
I bought these for my 3 year old. He loves these. He figured out he could change the colors on his shoes. he still shows them off to people! i would buy these again for sure!
The boys just love them
We bought 2 pair of these for our 2 sons.  They were super jazzed about the lights, so we were very disappointed when they fell apart so easily.  They are way overpriced for the quality!  The worst generic shoes at Walmart would probably have held up better.
Bought it for my son and one of the shoes didn't light when he was jumping up and down on it..try yes, I turned it on but I think it was malfunctioned.. but he loved it..
lit up so that was cute but the shoe is pretty wide for my son's feet and the back is low, so he kept slipping out of them.
Really good sneaker, a bit narrow
love this shoes
These shoes are kind of expensive; however, in my opinion, they're worth every penny. This is the 2nd pair I've purchased for my 2 year old grandson. They're durable and VERY easy to put on. Highly recommended!!!
We loved the Skechers GoRun, and expected he same nice wide fit with these. Unfortunately they are much more narrow than the GoRuns and are a little tight on my little guys chubby feet.  Otherwise we like them!
Great shoes
These shoes appear very comfortable, I love the style and colors.  They are both very nice looking and very comfy.  She usually indicates when shoes are uncomfortable not with these.
I was worried about the duplicate sizes listed, 8M US Toddler,  and 8 Toddler M.  Still not sure if there is a difference, however the US were sold out so we got the latter and they fit my 3 year old great.  They have stiff soles so they are a little loud when she walks but they are really nice shoes.  We get compliments everywhere we go, people just love them.
Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. They are so bright and sparkly, and she loves the lights. Sketchers are great shoes for little kids. Cute and comfy for long time wear.
These are so great, fit as expected if your child as narrow feet these will do ,there is an elastic band inside the shoes that gives feet and extra hold also the light on shoe can be turn on and off which Is awesome love them , gave them to a friend's daughter for her birthday she did not want to take them off and to add  they are so pretty and very  so girly, great fine
Love sketchers twinkle toes, however felt these ones were not the same quality.One, they are not easy to get on and off.<br />This has elastic underneath the tongue to prevent to be able to open very wide a must when you are trying to get shoes on a very squirmy toddler.<br />They light up on the pink bottom part, not on the top. I have washed my daughters other ones in the washing machine before and let them air dry (mulitple times and held up awsome) ... these unfortunatly did not do the same. the writing started peeling off, and just didn't look the same.
love these only problem is they are narrow and hard to get on they help up well tho suggestion is get bigger size seeing the run small
the only problem i had with these was the little gems on the toes where they light up are falling off. this id disappointing for a sketchers brand of shoe. not sure if i would buy again because of that . we all like shetcher but these are falling apart and dont light up alot only i a small area on the toes and if it loose the gems then less lighting and my grandaughter loved them at first. but now they dont light up as much.
Very cute!!Twin granddaughters love the light up shoes...They have already had a pair they our grew!
Bought this for my 6 year old and he loves it. Fits perfectly as expected.
Perfect fit,support and comfort.didn't know what to expect but i am pleased with this product. Exactly what i was looking for.
Superb.  For 3 months I have worn them every day (for about six hours daily) on the gritty streets of Times Square.  Incredibly, they barely show any wear! Tough as nails & comfy, at a great price.  Buy them.  Yes, NOW!
I ordered these for my grandaughter and they arrived weeks ahead of the promised delivery date! They are adorable, she immediately got them out of the box and handed them to her mother to put on for her. They are really cute, unique here in the US, and are quite attractive. I would buy them again.
My favorite summer shoes. Very comfortable and supportive. I bought another pair.
This is not different from all my other shoes I buy from Sketchers, I love it! This is the only brand of shoe I purchase.
I ordered these shoes in natural color, size 10. They are as described and very comfortable too, but being used to European sizes, I've mistaken and ordered it too large for me. Since I really liked the shoes I contacted the customer service asking to return them for a smallest size. I had a quick and satisfactory reply and about a week later I received the sandals in size 9. Great shoes and great customer service, as well! 5 STARS!!!!
Wife loves em.
My daughter loves them!
Really pretty shoes. My daughter loved them.
love them
Love these shoes & so did my daughter. Stylish & pretty bright colors. Comfortable. Durable. Light up.
How can sparkly lit shoes not be good...she loved them...especially in the dark.
returned to small
nice for mi little kid
great for the kids
shoe I ordered was for a little girl of 12 months instead I came In a big girl shoe as 8 years old
These are one of the cutest pair of shoes I've seen!  My 7 year old loves them and wants to wear them every day to school. Fit nicely and have held up great!
very good, Thanks
My daughter loved them so much I think we ended up with 3 pairs
Excellent product
Excellent!!!
My 5 year old daughter loves these shoes!!!
Bought these for my 1 year old.  I was having trouble getting her to walk more - she liked crawling because it was faster for her.  Got these and she loved that they light up and was happy to walk to make that happen.  As a bonus, they are SUPER cute!
The shoe lights up quite prettily. I would say that it is really a &#34;party&#34; shoe and not one for pre-school as the lights could be quite distracting. It met my expectations based on the information provided on the website.
ok
My Granddaughter loves these shoes! The only bad thing about them is that if she wears them too long, they make her feet sweat pretty bad.
Love the shoes, daughter loved them, too, for a long time.  Now I suspect they don't fit, but she still wants them, but doesn't wear them.  Wish they made ADULT sizes!
Good quality. This brand seems to run a bit large.
These shoes are adorable and our 2 yr old loved them.  I'm giving one star because I've purchased 3 pairs of these in different sizes and all 3 had one battery die in one of the shoes in all 3 pairs.  We didn't even make it through a season, one being very short because it was winter and boots were mostly worn, yet  even that pair had one battery die.  These are too expensive to be that disposable.
My 10 year old love's them
The left sneaker light does not work
Perfect for my 8yr old daughter!
My daughter loves these shoes. They look adorable on her :)
The zipper broke after only a month of my daughter wearing them.
Beautiful!  And very good price.
My daughter loves them!
These shoes are pretty durable overall, but the soles can take a lot of damage. The lights work really well and no problems after a couple spins in the washing machine!
Looks great ... durable and the best part is my daughter loves it even after almost an year.
exelente
I like how they look but they are for mygrandaughter. She will get them in july when she comes here for camp
Sadly the lights on one shoe stopped working after only a couple months.
ok
Excellent shoe, bought as birthday gift for my kid..<br />Unbelievable.. That the lights are still lightening as bright as same, though after one year, used roughly..!<br />Comfortable shoe!!<br />My child just likes.... Would by the same again for the next year!
SUPERBE CES CHAUSSURES TRES BELLES
My little daughter loves this model.  This is the second pair and she is just happy.. I hope to keep getting more models like this..
We purchased these shoes for our 2 year old daughter because her ankles are very loose and we wanted her to have comfortable shoes that would support her ankles while she walked. These shoes are not only very comfortable and sturdy, but they are beautiful! Our daughter has received compliments everywhere she has worn them from kids to adults! She loves the attention and tends to do a catwalk for everyone to model these shoes that light up! LOL. Highly recommended by our daughter and her parents!
bought these a year ago and everyone compliments my daughter on them - they are unique and fun, totally worth the money, and the zipper on the side makes them easy to put on
My daughter loved these shoes until she outgrew them. The sparkly lights made her the envy of every other child!
Niece loved them.
Sorry, I chose them too large for her.
Love this shoe.comfortable fit.
I love these shoes! I get tons of compliments everywhere I go. I'm a size 6W women so a size 5 big kid fits me well. Got them to replace another pair that I wore out and some of the lights had gone out. That takes about 18 months of fairly frequent wear. They are bright and fun and the Velcro makes it easy to get on and off. Only issue I had is that one of the lights wasn't aligned with the hole so I had to cut the hole a bit bigger and add some extra fabric glue. These will take a beating and keep twinkling. I put my old ones through the washer, which I'm sure you shouldn't do but they still twinkled after.
My daughter loves them!!! A bit big but she can wear thick socks till she grows into them besides she won't take them off!!! Great buy!!
Really cute shoes!
granddaughter loves these shoes.  two months later and they're still twinkling.
Sneakers were for my granddaughter. She loves them and has not complained about any discomfort
My daughter loves these alot of bang for your buck if u want to be considered the greatest dad these do the trick
very beautiful my little girl was obsessed with lights, it's good material I was afraid about color but looks very nice.
excelente
Purchased in the beginning of August 2014. After daily ( not so gentle)use they finally wore out. Lights still work.
My kids love these shoes, they are affordable and come in great colors and styles.
My daughter has worn these everyday to her first year of school, I will definitely buy her next pair of shoes through ya'll
Quality value fit good and light up
Great Skechers quality again
I bought for my granddaughter.  Looks and fits great.
Lights are funny
disappointed one of the shoes will not work leds ..
Really nice
Nice shoes.
These run big, as do most sketchers and we love that they light up from the sole of the sure. Definitely different!
These shoes didn't even make it to the summer.  They are already falling apart and we've only had them since April 12, 2015.  My husband had to glue the soles back onto the shoes so my daughter could wear them a few more days until they could be replaced.  I don't recommend these shoes to anyone since they didn't even make it to the 2 month mark.
My little girl loves it. The sole lights up, what more could you ask for? Just a note, there is a on/off switch on the left rear of the shoe. We thought, it was faulty when the lights stopped working but luckily we found the button.
The &#34;switch&#34; was hard to find .... was actually clever part of pattern on side of shoe
i like
I love it
She loves them!
Very cute. Nice quality
Purchased this for my granddaughter, they are absolutely adorable and she LOVES making them flash when she walks. Perfect!
My daughter refuses to take them off!! Bought a Size 12.5 for my 4.5 yr old  she is tall and has big feet for her age
This is a really cute shoe and my daughter has been wanting a pair of light up shoes. Upon arrival, one of the shoes did not light up. We were really disappointed. I requested a replacement from Amazon and it was shipped immediately. We have sent the defective pair back and are currently awaiting the replacement pair.
My granddaughter wouldn't take them off!
My daughter likes it very muchï¼Œ but as expectï¼Œit goes bigger as her feet are not big enough to wear itï¼Œwill wait
I bought them for my granddaughter. She loves that they light up. I bought them a little bigger so sge van wear them longer.
My daughter loves twinkle toes Sketchers!! That's all she wears!
Granddaughter liked them
It was a present for my nice and she LOVED them!
Cute shoes but the lights on one stopped working after the second wear.  My five year old was devastated!
Cool shoes! And I love that the twinkles have an on/off button. Take note, these shoes seem to run about a half size large. I have to return them for a smaller size.
One side did not have lights, and the lights did not last as long as the Sketchers we bought from a retail store.
I can't answer all the questions as I bought these for my niece's 3rd birthday. As soon as she saw these shoes, she fell in love!!! She immediately put them on and stomped around everywhere for hours!!!
I guess I am a cool grandma now because of these shoes. Who knew?
My seven year old loves them!!
Who doesn't love shoes with lights.
Fit perfect. Daughter loves them. Colors show exactly.
My daughter loves these shoes. She is picky about her shoes and wears these constantly. They are good looking shoes too and she gets compliments on them constantly. The only issue is that if you get then wet they are going to stop lighting up. The light up feature only lasted a couple of months before they were both not working. No real impact to the shoes of course but a bummer none the less.
My granddaughter loves these shoes.  They have soft insole so they are not so hard when she is running and jumping.  They do run large.  I bought a 7.5 but is most shoes she wears a size 8.  She also has a narrow foot and the velcro closing works perfect for her little feet.
This product runs about a half size to a size too large.  The stitching on the Velcro tabs is weak and does not hold up as it should.  I actually sewed them back down so my child could continue wearing them.  The only reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 3 is that my kids LOVE twinkle toes, and I never have to fight them to put their shoes on.
Great shoes. My granddaughter is happy. I am guessing at how they fit since she cannot really tell me. But she loves them.
cute
Love them! My daughter loves them!
GOOD
The lights went out on the shoes after the first few weeks.
My 4 year old loves these shoes.  Take note that the switch for the lights is in the star on the outside of each one.  I thought the lights had quit working on one after the only wearing them twice.  Then, I found the button to turn them back on.  She seems to turn them off easily with wear throughout the day.
My 6 year old daughter love these sneakers
My kids love it, and they seem comfortable to them.
First off, I find these shoes very expensive given that they are for a young girl, but I made the investment because my daughter loved them and had been dying for light-up shoes. However, on the first pair we ordered, the lights did within less han a week. On the second pair, the velcro cam detached from the straps on one shoe withn a few weeks, which I fixed with superglue; I soon had to do the same with the other shoe. Note that my daughter is not rough on shoes. We kept the shoes because my daughter loved them so much, but I would neveer buy these again. I would expect more endurance from a child's sneaker, especially one at this price.
Awesome sneakers except the lights on the left one went out in less than a week and no way to fix and style discontinued.
Girls love wearing them . They sing twinkle ,twinkle little star when lights are flashing. Sneakers are really pretty.
My daughter loves these.  Great buy for the price.
My daughter loves them!  You can turn the lights on and off if you wish!  Super cute shoes!
toddler can only wear for a short time very heavy
excellent product thoroughly recommend
Good value for the money. Shoes fit good easy for my granddaughter to put on and take off independently.  She loves the color of the shoes and the lights on the toes!
Daughter loves them.  Very bright, durable, but not recommended for sports or anything.  Good school sneaks on a non-PE day.
LOVE these shoes and so does my daughter. They run big but knowing that I ordered the perfect size. Cute!
These are so cute and the only shoes both my daughters want to wear. There is a button on the side that can be pushed to turn off the light up mechanism. The only down side to these shoes is that my girls other shoes are not being worn now!
LOVE these sneakers...
Not a fan of skechers. The Velcro is already coming off after 1 week.
Nice sneaker and priced right.
These shoes are cute and match almost any shirt, which is why I bought them for my 3 year old daughter. In less than one month the straps broke apart and they looked junky. She still wears them sometimes, but I was disappointed in the quality for the price! I will not be purchasing this brand again. She has Converse, Nikes etc and has worn them all  for months and they still aren't falling apart!
Very disappointed in these shoes. They are very cute, but that is it. My daughter has been wearing these sneakers for a week. Right out of the box, one of the shoes didn't light up. We were OK with that. Now, a week later, the fabric has torn in two spots along the sides and the rubber is pulling away from the sides in several areas. These are $40+ dollar shoes and look like this after one week. We have done nothing out of the ordinary.  Follow up: I emailed Amazon regarding this issue and received no response
My daughter loves it. Even wanted to sleep with them. A little too sparkly but she love that
Velcro tore off within a month and had to be repaired?
These are the only shoes my seven-year-old daughter wears--we just go from one size  to the next. they are comfortable,  good for narrow feet, easy to put on yourself , and light up which is fun. they even have an on off switch. the only problem is sketchers that they wear out very quickly...but often kids have grown out of them by then.
my granddaughter wore the sneakers twice and the flap separated i had to hot glue them.I also bought them for my other granddaughter and so far no problem.
Great sneakers, my daughter loves them.
The right shoe did not light up, but my daughter had already worn it outside so I didn't return them.
velcro straps are coming apart after a month and a half of use pretty sad for how much they cost expected better quality color coming off straps also and one of the buttons doesnt work already
My child loves these shoes but the gems fall off easily and super fast. We won't buy them in this style again.
On one of the shoes some of the lights stay on all the time.
bought these for my granddaughter.  She loves them.
They are a little heavy for kids shoes, but very nice shoes
Cute shoes!  Bright lights-my 8 yo loves them.
But nice and good
My daughter loved them! They even have an on/off switch.
Bought for my 6 year old daughter who LOVES them
Exactly what we were looking for but couldn't find in our town. Daughter loves them! Love the off button- and so does her teacher :)
Great!
The shoes are cute and comfortable but the lights do not work, very disappointing
My daughter loves these sketchers!  They seem to be holding up just great!
My grand daughters best friend has these,she wanted some and thank goodness I found them on Amazon. They were a big hit. Nice that you can turn them on and off.
I ordered the wrong size.
My daughter loves them!
These shoes are adorable and my granddaughter loves them.  They are a little stiff but I assume she will be wearing them constantly as soon as they loosen up.  She loves the twinkle toes!
Very disappointed - we have bought many pairs of Twinkle Toes Sketchers for my 7 year old over the years and this was the first pair for my 5 year old. When they arrived, they were not in an official Sketchers box, didn't even light up and were missing gems on the toes. I wanted to return them but my 5 year old was so excited to get them and wanted them for vacation that she said it was ok. On vacation, one shoe started to light up, but they both lost almost half the gems on each foot over the course of a week! She doesn't seem to mind, but I am very frustrated at the quality of this pair, especially for the money. It makes me wonder if they are counterfeit since I have never had an issue in the past from other sellers, or on 3 other pairs of Sketchers Twinkle Toes from Amazon.
We have bought Twinkle Toes a few times now, and we got these in the 'Multi' (pink) for both of our kids.  The first pair had a problem after about a month; one of the lights got stuck on and wouldn't flash or turn off, even when we tried to turn the lights on and off.  The replacement pair has a problem where the lights will randomly turn off and we have to use the button to turn them back on again.  It's not a huge deal, but kind of an annoyance that they keep turning themselves off.<br /><br />The fit seems fine, the fabric is stiffer and more durable than previous pairs we had, so I think they will hold up well.  My daughters have wide feet and these still fit fine, but with the velcro straps I think they could go tighter for a narrower foot.  I do recommend Twinkle Toes in general, but this particular shoe seems like it has some problems with the lights.
Daughter loved them. The lights on the one shoe are really dim after just 5 days.<br /><br />Sent them back because lights stopped working after 1 week...<br /><br />Next pair..,<br />After 1 month of not heavy use they have fallen apart. The top up by the lights has peeled away and there is a hole in the bottom heal. Waste of money.
Arrive before the expected date lights works the colour is what is shown on the picture I love it an would recommend to everyone
This is my daughter's 4th pair of Twinkle Toes. She loves them and they last for a long time. They are ridiculously cute.
I found these to be way too large for my daughter. She's currently wearing a 10 and I ordered an 11 to hope she could wear them now and also grow a bit comfortably, as with another pair of shoes she has. Well, the 11 ended up to be about 2 inches too long for her - way too big to wear now, so I returned them.
You need to know skechers twinkle toe shoes run large.  My daughter wears a size 12.  I ordered size 11.5 and there's plenty of toe room. Knowing that, once you find the right size you should love these shoes...we do!  this is our third pair of twinkle toe shoes.  My daughters favorite because they are pretty and the lights.  My favorite because the shoe is well made.  The thick bottoms saved my daughters feet from a large sharp piece of glass.  it was wedged in the bottom of the shoe but never got through.  had the bottoms been thin her foot would have been cut.  Thank you Skechers!!!!<br />Plus skechers do not look as worn out as other shoes by the time she grows out of them.  So far battery life of the lights have been good but even if we lost the lights I would still be happy because of the shoe itself.  This particular pair have glitter that can rub off on your hands when putting them on. Doesn't bother me too much just thought I'd mention it
These snazzy shoes were a birthday gift for my granddaughter.  She loves them though<br />added that her feet hurt after she had worn them.  However,, she didn't complain when<br />wearing them recently so I think I made a good choice.
One of the shoes does not light up when walking which upsets my grandaughter she has to manually push button
She loved them & doesn't want to take them off!
They're not comfortable shoes, but they're soooo cute and colorful.
Love!!!!!!
Perfect! You girl loves it!
My daughter loves these! These shoes are sturdy for what they are and completely adorable. These shoes actually lasted the entire school year last year.
Great shoes.  This is my daughters second pair.  Her other pair are over a year old and still light up, but they are too small and getting worn out on the soles.
Very sparkly and cute.  The light ups are bright!
Bought these for my daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves them. I love them too.. Exactly like the picture.
When I first received the shoes the right one never lit up. I sent them back even though my 6 yr old was excited to wear them right away. The replacement has the EXACT same problem!!!! Only the left shoe lights up. My daughter wauted so patiently for thr the replacement shoes that sending them back and running the risk of having the same problem was not worth it because I had an anxious 6yr old ready to wear her new twinkle toes. I am not happy at all about paying for defective shoes,replacing them only to have the same issue!
Great shoes!! My daughter is in love with them. The shoes are exactly as pictured, too. I wish I had some for myself :)
I bought these for my 4 year old daughter. She went absolutely crazy over them! They are adorable and fit just as I had expected. Once again Sketchers Twinkle Toes are a huge hit!
FantasticI
My granddaughter lived this shoe
A+
I bought this shoes for my daughter and she loved it.....the size is perfect, comfort is beyond words for her, and the light up feature the shoes has, made heads turn everytime. I would recommend these shoes very highly.
excellent gift for my daughter, although I am late sending.
My daughter wears these every day, loves them! A little stiff at first, but after wearing them a few times they fit real nice
My daughter loves these shoes. We were a little disappointed on the picture as it does show laces but we thought they were the type that didn't need tied.  With the shoe laces we have been able to teach our daughter to tie them so the disappoint has faded. The shoes are wearing pretty good thus far and they still light up. Great product.
My 6 year old daughter loves these shoes and we are very happy with them.
Love them my kid is obcessed with them
Super cute but run about a half size big. My daughter loves them though!
True to size. My DD loves these and she gets many compliments!
My daughter can't get enough of these and the fact that they have an on off switch is great for those times that you can't have flashing lights around you, such as at night when driving in the  my daughter can't get enough of these and the fact that they have an on off switch is great for those times that you can't have flashing lights around you car.
Elastic broke within the first week of ware. Had to return them.
These shoes are adorable! I love them, and baby thinks they are awesome, too. (Because, you know, lights!)
My daughter loved them! They light up. They are so cute. Im buying her another pair, as she has grown out of these already.
Granddaughter loves them~ twinkle toes works great too
Our daughter absolutely loved these!! Will be buying more!
Super cute! Fits well. Good for school.
I Bought these shoes for my grand daughter as a gift and she lives in an other state then I she,she told me thank you for the shoes till the I got to go see her c or my self Sh r just Loves the shoes and will be needing news soon for Feist grade.
Look great on my daughter!  Thank you for the quick delivery!
Two year old girl loves them!  She wears them nearly every day, and they are going 2 months strong. (Good for our house).
On time and perfect
LOVE this style boot!! SKETCHERS... Why don't you keep making these?? CLEARLY they are a HIT!!!<br /><br />We had the black last year for our then 3 year old... We really wanted the black again this year in the next size up, but there were no more left! We settled for the pink because we liked the style boot so much last year!<br /><br />SKETCHERS, PLEASE BRING THESE BACK THIS WINTER IN THE BLACK TOO!!!!
So adorable, my daughter loves them and never wants to take them off, the lights are a fun touch and the bows on the back are darling.  Very happy with these
Really cute!
Kids love them. Warm, stylish and very hard wearing.
Love this boots! I bought them Monday afternoon and they arrived today! My 2 year daughter loves them so much. She can use it all day long.
My daughter loves themðŸ˜Š
Boots are cute! My daughter loves them!
The size is too large, but it's beautiful and cute! My daughter and I love it!
My girl loves these boots and wears them almost everyday, even on warmer days. bought a size up but hasn't been an issue.
Bought these boots great price and they are adorable in person
My daughter loved them she even use them in summer time lol
That's Boots are a magazine I get for my little sister and she fall in love !!
Daughter loves them. 2nd pair she has owned and wears all day to school quite often.
VERY NICE BOOT....
I got this pair and the pink ones. My girls love them!
My daughter is in love. Just as i expected.
Loved them.
The boot is super cute but the side buttons break easily. I bought a pair for my daughter, the buttons busted right away. Amazon did send me a replacement right away but unfortunately the buttons broke on these shortly after as well.
ðŸ’›
LOVED ITEM!!!!!
They fit good, look good, and nice and cozy. They are perfect!
A little bit too wide at the top for a narrow leg.  The light ups are a big treat :)
Very nice , those shoes are very confortable and warm ....
I'm surprised at the cheapness of this product. I often order my children item from Skechers and the quality is always a really good!
EXCELLENT!!!
These shoes are very cute. I always purchase Sketchers. This particular style can be a bit hard to put on otherwise I would've given 5 stars.
My daughter loves these!
In less than a month the emblems, stones, etc are all falling off the shoe
Really cute shoes!
A gift for my 7 year old niece and she loves them! They fit her perfect! They arrived when expected....Thank you!!!
good~~
My little 6 yr old neice loves these - wearing them now even though its not wet out the light up soles are adorable and the colors/print is bright/clear/ seem to be very durable I am sure they will be passed on to the 3 year old and then some other lucky kid
I bought these for my 2 year old daughters birthday as part of her birthday present, and she loves them! My favorite thing about them is that the heels light up with each step! She can wear them all day long (with thick socks!) and they don't leave any marks on her feet like her previous rubber boots do.<br /><br />She wears these a few times a week fishing, in the water, in the sunshine, in the rain, ect., and they still are bright and vibrant... no cracks or lightening of color. Very high quality!! Skechers has always been a favorite brand of mine and they hit the jackpot with these little boots :)
My 3 yr old loves these boots so much. She barely takes them off.
Love Love love these! They are well made and love the lights especially when she jumps in puddles.
Very very cute!
Terrible! Caused my daughter to bleed and bruise where top of boot meets leg.
These rain boots are adorable and even light up. We have them to my daughter as a gift before it rained and she insists on wearing them with every outfit now--regardless of the weather. She's two and a half and has a lot of energy so the only thing I will say is that they are not good for running since the material is stiff, but other than that they are perfect.
Good!!!!!!
Love them
Excellent my kids love them
Fit great and super cute!
Got this for my granddaughter.  She loves them
Adorable I'd buy again
So cute and sparkly! My granddaughter loves them!
EXCELENTE
very much liked them and so did my grandaughter
beautiful
My 3 year old loves them . Fast delivery
They fit great and they're comfortable for her to run in
My granddaughter was so excited to get these. She loves them. Delivery was fast.
Bad quality.It looked cheap and the left shoe didn't light up.
Nice price, fast shipping
My youngest loves Twinkle Toes but its hard to find variety in her size.  Was glad to find them here at a decent price!
Got these ( size 5 for my 18 month old) because it said light up! What a waste! Now my little one watches teary eyed as her sister's matching pair (from another vendor) twinkle on! A crying shame!
My daugher loves it. So far no complain of discomfort so I assume they are good fit as i bought her usual size 10.
Cute but way to big. I ordered 8 Toddler and her toe just hit the bottom of the white part..sad little girl :-(
Good
We LOVE these shoes and get complimented on them all the time. Yes there are only 3 lights per shoe, but when they reflect off of the other sequins it looks like more. My only complaint is that my daughter looks at her feet too much when she walks lol.
my daughter loves it!
Excelente
Nice price for these.
My daughter loves her &#34;sparkle shoes.&#34; Totally work the expense.
Great quality, they're stylish & my daughter especially loves that they light up. 1st pair of shoes she leaves on, theyust be comfortable too. Nice that the lights have an on/off button. Will likely buy these again when she needs the next size :)
I bought these for my granddaughter.  She absolutely loves them.
My five year old daughter picked these out and she absolutely loves them. They are pretty cute and sparkly. I especially like that you have the option to turn the light-up feature on and off, as the older ones did not have this. They are comfortable, true to size and easy to slip on.
These were my first pair of twinkle toes for my little girl and I'm so glad I purchased them very well made pretty colors and they light up every step she takes to see her running around the house showing everybody her shoes is awesome they also have a heart shape button on the side that lights the shoes if you squeeze it and taking walks at night the lights provide safety for passing vehicles she wore them the entire summer without complaining about her feet hurting great shoes
Children's eyes light up when they see and put these on! Comfortable and very durable. You can't go wrong with these!
My 18 month old niece, has a  high instep & chubby feet. Shoes are so hard to find that fit her comfortably. She normally wears Stride Rite size 5W. These 5M Sketchers  fit great with a little room to grow. I suppose that's why they don't sell them in 1/2 sizes. These shoes are so sparkly & gorgeous in person. I also bought the  Sketchers Kids Shuffles Lights 10472N in pink. They are constructed well, with great support. They also open wide so they are easy to get on & off her little cherub  feet. She loves them, so does Mom.  ANY little girl will LOVE them. Her brother even loves them, he says &#34;They sparkle like diamonds&#34;!
My daugher loves these shoe's and they fit perfect. Yes, she can wear them all day for they are well made.
My granddaughter love her shoes. Came today's before school started. Thank you so much for making sure they were on time at no extra charge. I will be ordering sketchers boot for the winter. Great Job.
More for the buck. Arrived before expected date. Lights work,  two pair of shoe strings, true to size fit. Surely won't be the last pair I purchase!
Bought this for school for my six year old daughter, she loves it so much!!
Just received the shoes and they did not fit and the light up didn't work on one of the shoes
Exactly what I ordered! Very colorful and bright.
I purchased the shoes because of the weave pattern. I was worried they would be too big but I purchased a half size larger and it fit my 5-year old just fine. A little loose but there's enough room for her feet to grow over the course of the year. She loves the fun use of color. If you're little girl is into glitter and all that is girly, she will love these shoes.
My daughter loves them. Matches everything!!!
Great sneakers
The only thing I do not like is these shoes are a bit too heavy for a little one. And the soles are a bit too hard. But overall she loves to wear them!
Awesome! My daughter loved them...
Great product... So cute... Very good price... My 4 year old loves it!! I like the fact that it is so colorful it goes with almost anything ...
My 5 year old was so disappointed when she put these shoes on. Only one of the twinkle toes shoes would light up. She just loves these light up shoes. I will be returning these ASAP for a refunds!
BOUGHT THEM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES THEM.
good shoes for my 5-yers old doughet!!! not very warm, but comfortable and good quality!!!
Super cute!  Shoes are supposed to light up but one shoe rarely does.  Still great shoes and great deal!
My daughters love these boots. They say it is very warm and comfy.
One shoe didn't light up and they couldn't replace
Great shoe for my granddaughter.  Skechers make great shoes, and I also love to wear the brand.  These have memory foam insoles which make them all the more comfortable.  They light up on the toes when she walks and they are a fun design.  Very cute.
I ordered the wrong size so i had to return, but they were very cute and quality was great.
ðŸ‘
I had my daughter's foot measured and bought the size but they are to big. I think the shoe is cut on the larger side. They are very cute and true to the pictures. The cushion insert seems to be good as well.
My daughter is the envy of all her classmates. They're better than I expected.
My daughter loves twinkle toe shoes. However we ordered a 7.5 in this style and it fits smaller than a 7 in another style. May be because of the memory foam sole. But she says these are too small so saving for her younger sister.
Fit good and my daughter loves them!! Came on time too:)
my granddaughter loves them. Cutest tennis shoes. I loved them. Quality was outstanding.
Well made. Very cute.
Good
Lovely little girls shoe. I like the easy strap function for my 5 year old
My 3 year old saw a commercial for Twinkle Toes on TV and told me she wanted some. I looked on the Skechers website and really didn't want to pay over 40 for shoes that she will grow out of quickly (especially since she's in her picky stage and often times might not even wear new shoes I buy). These, on Amazon, were the perfect price and actually CUTER than some of the ones on the Skechers website. It's the just right amount of sparkle and bling. We get LOTS of compliments on them, and my daughter loves them!
My daughter loves Twinkle Toes and these were a big hit;) She wears them to daycare and they get quite dirty and beat up but they still twinkle. Also they are very comfortable and have never caused her blisters or uncomfy feet.
We love them!! So many compliments already!
Loved it
My daughter loves these light up sneaked.  Daisy pattern matches all her summer clothes
Really cute shoes and fit as expected.  My 4-year-old niece LOVES them, so that's good enough for me!
It is very nice I like it .thank u
Great shoes, super cute
My daughter fell in love with it....
Very cute shoes firs well
Love
The fit was as expected. Got an awesome deal buying used. Described as being like new and they looked brand new! Grand daughter loves them! Had them  within a couple days after I ordered them.
My daughter loves them! Velcro strap holds her foot firm for good walking support. Glitter doesn't flake off.
They are beautiful
Great toddler shoe! Fun, flashy, and full of flair!
Love these shoes! This is the second pair that I bought my daughter! They are so fun!
Very cute sneakers!  My 5 year old hasn't complained about her feet being sore.
Fit perfectly on my 15 month old baby. Her feet is 4 3/4 inch and size 5 fits well and wide enough for babies with high instep.
very happy 3 year old
Gorgeous. They are wonderful and my daughter loves them.
These are adorable, well-made shoes.  I even had to put mine through the washing machine and they still light up.  The one large velcro strap is very convenient and holds well.  My 21 month old seems very comfortable in these shoes and loves to wear them.
These shoes are so stinking cute. They are easy for my daughter to put on by herself and she loves wearing them. They fit as expected to slightly larger which is great for room to grow. My daughter has been wearing these for several days a week for almost the last three months and all the lights still work great.
We are very disappointed with this shoe.  The Velcro does not hold and this shoe cannot be worn because of it.  I  would like to know what we can do.  I would be happy to send it back to you for a replacement.  Have you had issues with this shoe.  Let me know what I can do.  Do I need to deal with Skechers direct or can you help me.  Thank you very much.
Adorable shoes, my daughter loves them
Shoes
Got this for my granddaughter.  She loves them
These shoes are very cute but they are really not made for children that have narrow feet. They run on the wider side.
Really cute sneakers for my toddler granddaughter, just a little big could use half sizes. Otherwise she loves them.
My Grand daughter love these shoes so much we can't get her to wear any other shoes!
Beautiful shoes for your daughter - really like that they have decorative laces with Velcro hidden underneath. Daughter loves them ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
Love them!
My daughter loves them!! Wears them everywhere we go.  I will keep buying them every year!
I bought them for my 2-year old granddaughter.  She just loves them![[ASIN:B00M03UCLM Skechers Kids 10472N Twinkle Toes Pretty Blossoms Light-Up Sneaker (Toddler/Little Kid),Pink/Hot Pink,8 M US Toddler]]
Absolutely loved it!!!
These just couldn't be any cuter!!  Love them!!
My daughter loves them!!!!! Very confortable too.
Super adorable.  Fits great.
Too small for my two year old daugther
These shoes are absolutely adorable!  They were for my granddaughter.  They are called Twinkletoes because when she walks, the toe tops twinkle!  We get many compliments on them.  I will definately be buying another pair in another color!
I've bought a pair of these shoes for my granddaughter the past 3 years. She loves wearing her Twinkle Toes.
Just what we expected !
My daughter loves these shoes!  Because they are velcro, they are a little loose on top but the length is right on. We'll made.  Flowers seem to be stitched pretty well to shoe and of course the twinkling lights are a cute touch.  We're received sooner than expected.  We are very happy.
Very cute and true to size. The only problem I had was the black glitter on the outside began peeling almost instantly! My daughter, however, loves them! Afterall, they do light up!
My daughter was in love. She wore it everhwhere
very beautifulï¼Œbut too shineï¼Œnot good for my baby's eyesï¼Œa little hard
My daughter loves these shoes.  She gets lots of compliments from other kids and adults when she wears them.  Now that we have had them for a while, I can't figure out how to wash them without damaging the flowers.  So far, I have just been wiping off the white part with a damp cloth.
great shoe and fast shipment
One of the shoe's lights did not light up. Had to exchange it. Still waiting on the replacements so i will update this review when i get the new pair.
These shoes are very cute! My 3 year old helped me pick them out because pink is her favorite color and when they arrived they were even better then what we expected. She only wants to wear these shoes every day. They are so sparkly and adorable. They look great with dresses or pants. These are the perfect shoes for your girly preschooler! We have received many compliments.
Loved  the sneakers. About 3rd pair we bought. Toys are ridiculously priced but kids enjoy them  Meant to give music art a 4 star
May granddaughter loves these shoes.
Super cute shoes! My daughter loves them!
Gave this as a gift for my niece and she loved it! Mainly because it is color pink and has these cute little flowers.
Excellent
My Niece LOVE these shoes!!!!
Love them! Wish they twinkled when she walked not just ran/stomped.
We loved these, but one step into a puddle and the lights are now dead.<br /><br />And tomorrow is the first day of summer camp, so I guess I can add early morning shopping run to my list of chores.
My youngest granddaughter's favorite
Love them for school in sept!!!
These sneakers are perfect for my granddaughter who is three.  Got an 8T, with just the right room for growth and are very pretty to look at.  She loves them!!
Love them. Super cute and glittery. My 4year old daughter loves them. She's a size 9 and I got her the size 9 and they fit too big. Might be 1/2 a size off.
nice shoes<br />so cute<br />thank you
My granddaughter loves that the lights twinkle,bit I don't think it has great arch support--about average
My 18 month - old daughter Loves this shoes! The first time she wore this she was so mesmerized with the lights and kept on showing to people when they say she had a very cute shoes. It's her favorite shoes and got a lot of compliments. I will buy another pair in a heartbeat if she will outgrow it and I can tell it won't be too long. I highly recommend this shoes.
Very good no problems
should have taken one size larger they are exact  One side  is not working and I am very disappointed about this How can I get this replaced??????
Daughter LOVES these shoes. I do too!  Wish she didnt get them dirty so quick :-)<br />She is normally closer to a 8- but i got a 7 in these and they work great. (but not room to grow at this size- just good for now)
i like
Way too big...I measured my daughters foot...but something still went wrong. I probably need to contact someone about getting smaller size.
Perfect!
My daughter is a size 12.  I ordered a 12 k owing they run big but they were even bigger than expected.  Had I know I probably would have ordered a 11.
GOOD~~
I only keep ordering these because my daughter loves them and they are cute. But this is the 2nd pair I have ordered (different styles) and both times the lights on 1 foot would not work unless you slam the shoe really hard. Well my toddler does not walk hard enough to make that shoe light up. She doesn't seem to care that only 1 works, but since I spent the money, I care.
Bought this as a gift for the niece's five year old!  She loves it.
cute indoor shoes for my daughter
it is really perfect and comfortable
Good!!
everything as expected
My daughter loves them, can't comment on durability as ive only had them for a week.
good
My dughter like all pink garments,shoes,toys, and blingbling items,first skechers shoes was buy in Hongkong,she choose it in all shoes,include nike,adidas.so i plan to buy skechers shoe in the future
Adorable shoes, fit great for our 4 year old
good
they are so cute and my Grandaughter loves them
My daughter loves them. I just wish they sold half sizes.
I purchased these for my 18 month old granddaughter who loved them.  She especially likes them at night or where it is darker so that the lights really look bright.  I will purchase more as she grows.
These are absolutely perfect! Ordered them on tuesday, and received them on saturday with the free shipping. I was extremely surprised they came three days early, less then a week after ordering. The actual material surrounding the shoe is like a satin of somesort so they are shiny.The straps are actually a single strap with a square base. Both shoes light up perfectly on contrary to a couple of the other reviewers. They fit exactly as they should, and are very cute. My daughter absolutely loves them. (My daughter had another pair and they lasted a very long time before the velcro broke on a strap)
very good!!!
[[VIDEOID:2b507471fd420ec5e0f4084a28474de6]] These Skechers Kids Twinkle Toes Girl Grooves shoes I really, really wanted to love. My daughter chose them for school and she started school on August 17, 2015. It is currently August 31, 2015 and the right shoe's lights have stopped working. Plus, the jewels on the end of the toe block are coming off. When she first tried them on she loved them. The length is true to size, but they are a bit wide. I would recommend these as play shoes and not everyday shoes based on the issues I've had.<br /><br />First, she has difficulty making the toes twinkle and has to stomp. The sensor must be in the toe area, because if it were in the heel I would believe it would work easily. Like other reviews have said, the lights will stop working. I understand that all shoes that light up will eventually stop, but I was not expecting with in a couple of weeks. Another issue I've noticed is there is absolutely no arch support! It is a very flat shoe. I would recommend insoles if you choose to purchase.<br /><br />Again, cute shoes, but have many \\"kinks\\" that need to be worked out.
Really cute shoes!  Daughter loves them--the vibrant rainbow color is perfect and goes with everything.  They are tie shoes not Velcro, so make sure your child can tie their own shoes.
My daighter loves these shoes. These have come a long way since they started making twinkle toes. They seem a lot better made than before and a lot more comfortable ke. These shoes feature the memory foam on the inside which my daughter loves!
My granddaughter loves the shoes. Great fit and excellent condition after many wears. Had the shoes for a month now and they are holding up very well.
I had no idea they had memory foam. My daughter was so happy.
My 4year old LOVES these! They are bright and fun and not the typical &#34;princess pink&#34; commercialized light up shoe. (Which was hard to find with all the character themed ones listed.)  It was a great find and a great price.  My daughter has only had them a couple weeks so I don't know how durable they'll actually be, but they seem a sturdy, well made shoe. Size wise they seemed fairly close to typical sizing. I bought them with a little room to grow and that's what I got. We love these shoes.
I just love sketchers light up sneaker!!!
fast shipping good price A++++++++++
These are shoes are made to be noticed and my grand daughter gets comments about them whenever she wears them.
Good
Just to expensive for a child s shoe considering they grow out of them before they wear them out.
My daughter is excited about her lite up shoes.  They look, and feel good on her feet she said.she likjes the colors a lot I am so glad I got these shoes for her she is now all ready for this school year.
These are so cute. Bought size 2.5 (half size bigger than normal to last longer) for our 8 1/2 year old daughter. She loves them the tie dye and the blinking lights. Saving them to wear for school.
Cute shoes but the size is too big.  I think my daughter would need a whole size less what she wears in other shoes
My four year old absolutely loves these shoes!  Not only do they go with any outfit they also stand up well to outdoor play. Would definitely buy again
My daughter love them. The light is highly bright but since they don't turn on at the same time, it isn't annoying.<br /><br />I will buy a second pair for my younger daughter, maybe a different design but definitely the same brand.<br /><br />Recommended.
looked all over for these sneakers, wanted tie sneakers. All I could find in her size was Velcro closing. finding the tie die was a bonus, she loves tie die.
My granddaughter loves them.
I got a 1.5 but they run small so I'm needing a 2.5 what do I need to do
My daughter love this shoes, she says are very confortable...the shipping was good and the price also. They fit like i expected, my baby is almos 1 and i ordered 13.5
Cute shoes. The lace part is relatively short. The shoes can easily be &#34;slipped on&#34;, like princess/ballerina shoes. Only problem is they run big.
These ran a little bit  big!
My daughter loves these. Very happy with this purchase.
I like it
Very beautiful, but slightly larger
These were way too narrow for my disagrees feet. There is elastic inside the show by the tongue that restricts the fit for a medium to wide foot.<br /><br />They are adorable for the right size feet.
Awesome love love love.
Great fun colorful shoes!
Daughter did not like the heal hump; cute shoe though.
excellent, thanks
My 7 year old daughter wanted these for her birthday.  She loves them! I ordered 13.5 size, was hoping for size 1, but they didn't have that size. She fits into 13.5 and still has a little room for growth.
My daughter is extremely happy.
The shoes are great but run smaller. I've ordered before Skechers another style the same size but returned those because they were huge. These supposed to be ok but unfortunately run smaller...
Excelente!
My daughter loves these shoes. She says they are &#34;bouncy&#34; and make her jump  higher. I assume that means they are comfortable  ;)
Granddaughter loves them. She wears them all day at school.
Pros: Very comfortable inside with the &#34;memory&#34; design Nice look  Cons: The size comes too small. You have to order one size larger than normal. We had to exchange the first pair The sole of this shoe is too thick to be used for sports. When playing tennis or running my daughter rolled her ankle twice in these shoes. So for walking and moderate playground activities - these shoes are excellent but not for sports.
very confortable
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn...I love the memory foam insoles, which comfort my feet and at the end of the day my feet are not sore/do not hurt  like they were in other shoes I have worn...thanks for making the most comfortable pair of shoes!
I got these for my 7 year old daughter. She loves them and says they're the most comfortable shoes she's ever had.
front where toes go was ruined in a few days cause my kid likes to drag her feet. Thought they would be a bit more durable.
My daughter hasn't taken these off since we got them. They fit as expected. But if you have a kid with wide feet these may not work for you.
They are perfect my daughter loves them
Great sneakers would buy again
Beautiful
Good
The shoes are very cut.Love it!!
i love the desing
Loved them
Very nice, light weight sneaker. Love the color combination of bright pink and gray with a bright blue. Velcro strap makes shoe easy to put  on and take off. Ordered this in a kids size 2 and it fits great.
For a seven year old child that needs new shoes every six months they are great! stylish and durable materials!
only knocked off 1 star because they didnt last my little girl that long..... but she is pretty ruff on everything
My daughter loves them!
great
loved them
This shoe nice and fix for my daughter
I like skechers brand, it's more comfortable to wear. I bought it for my daughter. She likes it very much!
Great product
We bought them for my daughter as a surprise. The shoes are adorable and sparkle! She loved them and says that they are very comfortable.
Daughter loves the shoes, super cute and comfy
I like its quality, they are so light!
My daughter loves these shoes.  They fit perfectly and have held up pretty well for a 5 year old.
Good
Daughter LOVES them!
Super cute sneakers for my granddaughter!  They seem very comfortable for her.
My 7 year old granddaughter loves these shoes.  The silver is shiny and the nice blue and pink accents are lovely.  The shoes fit as expected and she says that they are very comfortable.  I have been purchasing Skechers for all four of my granddaughters since they really love the styles and color combinations.  Plus, I don't have to worry about the sizes being &#34;off.&#34;
i got this for my 6 years old girl and she loves them
My daughter is 9 and absolutely loved this shoe.  The white and grey sparkle is very pretty and goes with everything.  My daughter is on the autism spectrum and has difficulty tying her shoes.  She completely wore these out until they don't fit anymore.  I hope Sketchers will offer this style with the hook and loop closure in big kid sizes above 5.
We bought these shoes on April 10 of this year, and it's now August 2. So it's been about 3.5 months during a hot North Carolina summer (which means very little sneaker wearing). My daughter wore these to school about 10-15 times, and then during summer break about 5 times. So a total of 15-20 times, and I'm being conservative. She's about as far from a tomboy as possible (I have to make her go outside, and she almost always wears crocs when she does) and the &#34;grass&#34; where she played at school is that high-end artificial grass, so it doesn't get muddy or gross out there. In conditions like these, I'd expect these shoes to look decent after 15-20 wears. I'm not expecting them to look perfect, of course. But they look awful! All chewed up with the color and the sparkles rubbed off in several places. I don't think I can even give these to Goodwill. I've attached a photo so you can judge for yourselves. Keep in mind, this is 15-20 uses TOPS in very mild conditions.
My daughter loved it!!!
My grand daughter  had to get velcro for school she put them on herself
exelent product
6yr old daughter loves them. She said they're very sparkly and super light.
EXCELLENT
Love the brand.  Love the style.  Love the way they fit on little one.  No complaints!
Cute Skechers shoes. My daughter loves purple and Skechers and this combination was a winner in her book. She loves these shoes and wears them most every day. :)
My daughter has had the shoes for less than three weeks and already the material on the velcro strap has pulled away about 2 inches on both shoes. This is disappointing. We have had such good luck with Sketchers in the past. This pair is not holding up.
Excellent product, seller Recommended
Love them!
excellent
Lightweight and daughter likes them. She says they are comfortable and she always wears them. They show wear and tear pretty fast hence the 4 stars.
Great  shoes, good price,my graddaughter loved them.
She said it was like walking on clouds.
The sides remind me of shark gills. They look cool and my 8-year-old loves them. They go well with a wide variety of casual clothes and are supportive enough for her to wear to gym class. Perfect blend between laces and Velcro... they don't look juvenile like most Velcro shoes, yet they're easy and convenient for kids who are still not great shoe-tiers.
Purchased a second pair for my granddaughter. She is very active so I needed something that would wear good and be comfortable.
This is the first time I bought Skechers and it won't be my last. They are true to size and my daughter loves the fit and comfort. The colors are nice and bright.
My daughter loves these shoes. She's extremely tough in shoes but these have held up well!
My daughter loves them! So far they are holding up great!
Expectations were meet for these shoes
Daughter loves these shoes. They are a little different to the others that she has worn. She described them initially as bouncy. They looked well made and she assures me that they are comfortable.
It was for my granddaughter, she loves them!!!
Thank you fit perfect
Super fast delivery.  The shoes fits great and it's super light. My daughter loved it.
the insoles are thin, could be softer
Sketchers are very well constructed and always fit true to size!! We get many months out of them.
I bought it for my first daughter. She's gonna love this and comfortable! It's so light than other regular and great design shoes.
Granddaughter loves them.
Poor quality. Shoes ruined after two weeks used. :-(
Fit was on the mark and my daughter said they were comfortable
My daughter loved them!
GORGEOUS!!!!! Sooooo much prettier than the pic! Very glittery (without the actual glitter falling everywhere, more metallic material) and the light blue and pink really pop. My 5 year old was very pleases and said if Cinderella wore sneakers, she would wear HER sneakers, lol. They fit well too, Sketchers are great for normal to wider feet. If your child has narrower feet, just put cushier, thicker socks on them and they will be great. I am super pleased with these!
Great shoe I would buy them again.
Shoes are too big. I guess Skechers shoes run big for kids or is it Skechers in general?
Bought for my 5 year old, she loves them.  They go on very easy and are super cute!
Fits  nicely
i love it
great shoes
My daughter loves them
Bought these as a gift for my great-granddaughter who really likes the colors.
Beautiful show, but runs small.  Order a size bigger
Rapid delivery , the only issue is the shoes are larger than imagination
Really cute and comfortable.
My daughter loves these! She picked them out and so far so good! We've had them a couple of months now! I wish the bottom wasn't white because they get dirty fairly easy, but that's not a major issue. She really like them!
These are absolutely adorable!  So bright, a little shimmery, light.  I ordered a size 13 for my daughter who typically wears a 13.  They fit perfect with some room to spare.  The ONLY drawback is that the laces are a little short, especially if your child is in the early stages of learning to tie their shoes (not much to work with in terms of laces).  I may have to go buy new laces for the shoe.  Other than that, they are so cute!
it's hard to find a decent shoe for your child. My daughter said the shoe was very comfortable it fit just right. So now I am looking for different colors and styles of this brand. They make an excellent shoe.
These are great Skechers.  My daughter loves these shoes.  They are cute, holding up well, and she likes to wear them.  I might get some longer shoelaces, as these are a little short, tend to come untied, and are hard to double-knot.  But overall, great shoes.
Perfect fit, great price.
Granddaughter loves them..
These were a gift. The little girl LOVED them! Mom tells me they fit great!
This is the second pair I have ordered! The first pair is still in perfect condition after 1 year. 100% recommended
Love these shoes!  My daughter loved them as well.  :)
My kiddo loves them and so far I do too!  In addition, the colors keeps them from looking to dirty, a problem that is so easy to encounter with kids.
These styles of shoes always fit perfect on my little one. She can wear them all day long without any complaints.
My granddaughter loves these - but they are the 3rd pair I've gotten her this year. That's why I'm not giving them 5 stars, I know she is tough on shoes but it seems excessive to go through 3 pr of shoes since school started.  I've threatened to get her steel toed work boots next time!
Daughter loves them.  They fit her well and she wears them all the time.
GREAT, COLORFUL SNEAKS!
We had to wash them after my daughter stepped in mud.  They held up very well after that one wash!
We always buy skechers and when my daughter gets a new pair they still look good and hold up better then most name brand shoes. Quality kids footwear
My girls LOVE this pair of shoes....glow in the dark!!
my girl wanted shoes that glow in the dark and she loves them, she wears 13 now but i bought 13.5  she will use them for a while.
Loved these! These fit my daughter perfectly. She was very pleased with them.
My daughter loves them the color matched the color online. The size is a 'little' girl's 12. Fit exactly.  She is 7 and has small feet my five year old has 11 shoes.
The product was great and my kids loved it. BUT don't know why it was not shipped in its original box? I mean skitchers boxing ?
Daughter loves them. The glow really bright. She has had them for several months and they have held up well.
Good shoe for my girl: she just loves it.
Excelente
Great shoe for Lil Girl's
Fabulous shoes, run .5 small but can withhold a 5 year old toddler playing on the play ground, riding bikes ect. Good colors and come with extra shoe laces big plus for me
Great sneakers..very comfortable and my daughter loves the colors
Bought for a child I don't know for a mission project.  The shoes look nice and seemed well made.
The shoes fit my daughter well.  She love it. It took about 10  days shipping from U.S to  China, not too long.
Really cute and bought it for my daughter. She enjoys the color and especially that's her favorite color.
These shoes fit my granddaughter perfectly. They are very easy to put on and the colors are so bright and pretty. She loves them!
Light and colorful shoes with excellent fabrication quality
Loved theses shoes for my granddaughter they fit her just right and they gave her support she needed
Terrible quality, the coloring worn off in two weeks, very bad..
Fit great.  Simple well made. My little girl loves them.  They do not light up.
7 year old daughter was so happy with these.  We originally bought the size 1's and they were too big.  13.5 fit her well, but she loved the style of skechers so much that she begged me to keep the larger pair for later on.  Price was great too, even better than the prices at the skechers store at the outlet mall.
Very good quality shoes, beautiful & comfortable shoes, fit just right, this is my daughter's 3rd pair of shoes that I got for her.  We love Skechers!
what can I say my daughter loves this sneakers nice colors better than the picture
Shoes fit but too large in the heel, so no matter what size they would not work.<br />Sketchers must have changed the way they are making their shoes because I have never had this problem<br />and I was buying their shoes all the time.
My daughter loves them. She's seven, tall for her age, and was wearing size 2's last year so we went up a size to 3's. She has a little wiggle room but they fit her nicely and she says they're her favorite pair she's owned so far. She also likes the fact it's lace-less since she CAN tie her shoes, she just doesn't WANT to. Ah 7 year olds.
so beautifulï¼Œa little bit large
Great shoes and for the price - even better.  My daughter loves Sketchers.  She's a bit of a tom boy and her shoes come home covered in mud.  But they hold up otherwise.  These are great shoes and I highly recommend.
exceptionally comfortable
I love Skechers for my kids. The shoes can stand up to a lot of wear and they clean up easy. I have even thrown them into the washer and they come out looking brand new! They are also very comfortable and flexible for an active girl like my 8 year old daughter. Now if only her feet would stop growing, then she would get better use out of them!!!<br /><br />I will continue to keep buying these shoes for her.
very nice.
nice
My daughter loves them! They are very light.
Thanks!
Love them
Grandaughter wanted a pair of these and she loves them
My daughter Loves these shoes and the fit was exactly as expected
Super cute on my 5 year old. Item shipped fast and is exactly as described. Very light weight shoe.
My daughter loves them
Bought a size 4, for my 8 yr old daughter. And she loves them. She gets complements all the time. She says they are very light and don't weigh her down. She wears them to school almost everyday. Perfect buy!!!!! Will purchase again in the future:)
My daughter loves these shoes.  Cute and comfortable!
bought these for my 7 year old niece for her birthday, she loved them and they fit well.
Fit true to size.  This pair has been worn to school every day for the last 7 months and is still holding up!  That's the kind of durable, Skechers quality we love!
Way too big!!! My niece has to wait for 1 year to wear them, but they are very nice shoes for HOT school days!
I've purchased several pairs of these shoes for my girls to wear to school.  They love them.  They are cute, but still easy to run around in.  They stay on well, they are comfortable and have adequate tread on the soles so that they aren't slippery.  I love that they are fast to get on and off.  Much easier than laces!
excelente
Excelente
GOOD QUALITY AS EXPECTED FROM SKETCHERS
My daughter love these shoes for school. Have gone through a few pairs, will stick to them. Very comfortable, light and pretty too.
the best shoes for collegiate body, the girl loves to wear your shoes daily. super comfortable. I recommend it.
This is my second pair of shoes for my granddaughter.  They wore well.  Very happy
I was so excited to find these thinking they would be comfortable and a little dressy for my daughter to wear to disney.  We had a &#34;trial&#34; run ahead of time and to my horror they left her heals bloody and all torn up.  This is unusual for this brand and was a real disappointment.  The sad part is I waited too long to return the other pairs in varied sizes and I wouldn't wish these shoes on anyone so it will be a lose/lose situation :(
good
Buyer beware...the description on these shoes reads &#34;mesh overlay,&#34; which implies that these shoes have an interior lining...they DO NOT. The mesh fabric alone does not provide adequate coverage and/or protection from the elements. We purchased these shoes for our daughter to wear for school gym class, which is most often held outdoors, but because of this significant design flaw we will be returning them. We would not have bought them in the first place had the description been more accurate. Seller will refund the price of the shoe, however we must pay return shipping fee. Bummer.
Love these for my daughter! Colors are great!
Very Good!!!
granddaughter loves them
These are very nice and look to be well made. I purchased these for my 5 year old to wear now and into the school year. She's just gotten into a 12 and I bought these in a 12.5. She has about a finger width amount of space at the toe so I'd say these run true to size to maybe large. The have a good bottom and the colors are very pretty in person. I think she'll get a lot of use out of these.
Best shoes yet!!!  WOW!  We love these shoes!  The material is of an excellent quality, the color is a cheerful one and the design is a soft comfortable shoe!  Good traction, easy to get on, size runs true and I wish they had more at this price....lower priced here than other stores.  Now I see they raised the price:(  I would say keep checking back as the prices change ...  Thank you Amazon for carrying this shoe.  This is the first time we have tried this brand and we love it.   We are glad we took a chance on Sketchers.  If you get these shows I think you will not be disappointed .  Met and exceeded expectations!  Great for trail and pavement running btw....
I bought these shoes for my daughter in a size 4. I wear a size 7 and they fit me comfortably. Cute shoes but way to big!!
Great shoes
great quality !!
Good fit
Excelent
good
Shipped and arrived as stated.  They fit well and my daughter says they are comfy.  Love the bright colors and they've held up well through summer camp.
Like it
I usually wear 6 M,this time I bought 5M big kid, it is too large and wide for me
I thought these shoes for my 6 year old daughter were a little big compared to her other running shoes.
Great looking shoes, very cute for my 7 year old. We found them to run a little small (compared to a Nike) so we returned them for a half size larger. They are lightweight and comfortable. While I don't believe they will last much more than six months, my child will likely out grow them in that time. They are a decent quality shoe and for $20 you can't do better elsewhere.
Very comfortable shoes. Lightweight.
Super cute shoes, fit well
Great shoe for my 4 year old. Fast shipping and great price!
great quality !!
great
I bought these for my active 2 year old daughter. Easy on/off, and love the bright colors. Will definitely be returning to buy in an alternate color when she outgrows these!
These were a gift for my toddler granddaughter - length & width were fine - she loved the colors.
Nice shoes
A very good kids shoe. Better the nike shoe my niece has previously. She told me the shoe is very comfortable on her feet. She can wear it for hours. The sole is very soft and has good grip.
for my small granddaughter she loves them.
Bought these,as my daughter's daily school shoes. She loved the color. Quality was great as expected. These shoes lasted the entire school year and are still in good shape
Child loves them.
My daughter loves them specially the colors
I LOVE SKECHERS, SUCH GOOD QUALITY.
Fit well, comfortable and look great!
my daughter loves it very much and likes to wear it all days
ECELENTE
My daughter says it feels like she is walking on clouds in these shoes.
recomendado
Good shopping experience, good appearance and quality of shoes! Awesome!  the buyer from far away
Nice looking shoes, my daughter loves them
my daughter loves these shoes, 2nd pair
Good.....
My five year old enjoys wearing these sneakers.  Purple is her favorite color and I'm giving it 5 stars, since the fit is still good and she's still wearing it 5 months later.
My daughter loves these!  Very light weight and comfortable
Excellent sneakers; my daughter loves her second pair!
i love it
Nice, light weight running shoes with non marking soles.  My daughter wears them practically daily and runs track, plays tennis and everything in between.  Shoes are doing a great job of holding up, they still look new.  They were true to size and very comfortable.  I love that the colors aren't those insanely bright neon yellows/pinks/greens.  The non marking soles are a plus for playing tennis.
Adorable shoes
My daughter has medium to wide feet and these shoes are great for her. She loves the ventilation, as well; so, her feet don't get too hot.
My daughter loves these and they're holding up well.
My daughter absolutely loved these shoes :) She actually squealed with delight when she received the package.
My daughter loves these. Skechers are her favorite brand of sneakers.
Very short durability. Disappointed, as my daughter loved the style and colors. These lasted less than 3 months (of everyday use, in school and outdoors). For the price, this was very disappointing.
Good
It is very lovely and fit for my daughter of 4.5 years old.
Very satisfied with my purchase! They are a bit small but they fit and my daughter is very happy!
Good shoes but, they seem to be starting to fall apart I might have got a bad pair. Will be replacing!
They are super cute and bright. Skecher Sugar Canes are a most have for hip, girly girls.
My daughter loves these shoes!!!! They are super comfy and so cute!
My daughter LOVES these shoes and she is extremely active!
Excellent product!! My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves them!!
so greatã€‚
Nice
It seem to be really Comfy for my daughter but a bit too big. It's ok she'll grow into it
Very light weight. Love the Velcro strap to help get in easily. Will be perfect for the spring
Love this shoe. My daughter is able to put this shoe on & take it off by herself.
Excellent, my kids love them.
Only shoe my daughter wants to wear...only wish they had them in her size in red, navy, turquoise or something other than neon.
Good shoes. My daughter loves them
good
Great shoes. Vey soft with nice support. My daughter loves them!
Nice Shoes
very good product
I ordered these shoes for myself because I have very small feet and wear a ladies 3M and couldn't find any comfortable walking shoes in my size. Usually I wear a size 1 1/2 kids size but these ran a bit short, so I exchanged them for size 2M. They are a perfect fit and are exactly what I was looking for, something lightweight, extremely soft and without any seems that rub on your feet . I would highly recommend these shoes for kids and adults with very small feet like me.  They are extremely comfortable, and a great price too!
Love love love the sketches! Hot pink nice and bright. So lightweight u forget they are on! Kids size 5 fit like a women's size 5 1/2-6
Daughter loves them! So very comfortable and lightweight. Great for summer!
My daughter loves these (she is picky!). It's hard to find lace-up sneakers in the smaller sizes but she wanted to be all grown up, and I'm so glad we found these. Super comfortable and go with everything. I love the style (and want a pair myself!). I am going to order her the next size up. They still look new after wearing for a year so I will pass these down to my niece.
Excellent item
Excellent shoes for an active kid!
great
I bought this product for my daughter. She likes them much, saying she feels like walking on clouds.
My daughter say's it's very comfortable!
Awesome shoe! I want a pair for me!!! My daughter was very pleased with the comfort, look, and wear. Excellent price and all around a great purchase. Thank you.
My daughter loved it very light and comfortable
Beautiful shoes!  Just what my daughter wanted.  Fast shipping too!
They are comfortable , beautiful and light . My daughter loved them. I recommend it
daughter loves them
Very good
This is our second pair. My daughter doesn't like to wear anything on her feet. These shoes are flexible and breath well, making her feet much more comfortable!
My kids love these shoes, they are affordable and come in great colors and styles.
Love Sketchers
Good quality and great price!
Great sneaker daughter loves them.
My daughter loves them.
so so
My daughter love it.
Lasted a few months before they started to fall apart, especially the front of the shoe. These we also worn by my daughter, who is much more gentle on her clothing that my son.
So girly and comfortable.
It's a great pair of sneakers, but don't expect it to last more than a semester, especially if the kids are wearing it daily.  They will wear nothing else once they slide their feet into these sketchers :-) Great pair of sneakers, would definitely buy again!
EXCELENTE
I love all the color in this shoe. It is also nice because it is lightweight. Unfortunately the front piece has come undone so I had to glue it. Also the plastic front got scratched off after my daughter climbed a tree with them on. This is only a week after use. I do think Sketchers are a good shoe. Plastic material doesn't hold up well.
Good shoes!
Kid loves them.
granddaughter loves them
The shoe is very pretty but not made to withstand being worn by a child on a playground.  The purple on the toes has completely peeled off, they look like they are a year old vs. a few months.
Daughter loves these sneakers, esp. the colors and the velcro (hard to find larger size without shoe laces). However, the quality could be better for the price. The purple front part scuffed visibly after the first wear, some other material, not this very shiny plasticy strip, should be used on the toe area instead.
EXCELLENT
Awesome
My daughter just loved them! Great colors, great fit!
Purchased these shoes for my 6 year old daughter.  They arrived later then expected.  However, the package arrived in great condition and the shoes are excellent and obviously in new condition.  My daughter loves the colors and says they are very comfortable.  I love that my daughter can easily put these on and off herself.  The last pair we had which were similar lasted about 6 months which was good since they were worn almost daily.  I would recommend the product, my daughter loves these.
My daughter loves these.  Seem to be lasting fairly long for her (two months).
My kid seems to enjoy it. With this pair of shoes, my kid has not complained about foot or leg pain. Comfortable fit.
My dougther love it ! Very happy dad !
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ORDERED A 3/ 3.5. WE LIKE SKECHERS/WILL WAIT UNTIL SHE GROWS IN THEM.
My daughter loves these... Very comfortable good quality and super cute in person
Beautiful shoes. Fit wonderful. Only worry is the Velcro does not seem very strong, but hopefully, that will not be a problem.
Great!  Very attractive and comfortable for my daughter.  She loves them.
She  is 8 years old likes this shoes very much. Is very comfortable.
Great price for back to school
Great product ..great buy.
Because of the extra padding in the memory foam I believe the shoe fits tighter than normal so I returned my original size and got a half-size bigger.
Had a huge hole in the side after 7 weeks of normal wear. Nikes last my daughter forever. Amazon was amazing as always and offered a refund minus a stocking fee.
Great shoes for kids!
Thank you , its graet
Six year old girl loves the color and style. Shoe is very comfortable.
Its small
love
Super cute shoes! Fits as expected and my daughters loved them!
Nice and light. Fit perfectly
I bought these for my granddaughter, who has had some trouble with her feet since birth. She has always been comfortable in Skecher's and the size is always spot on. However, these are just a teeny bit narrow. Hopefully, they'll stretch to perfection. We are currently having her wear them for a couple of hours a day. She does love the memory foam and the fact that they are very lightweight. I would definitely by these again.
We purchased these shoes 2 weeks ago for our daughter and after only 2 weeks of wearing them, the inside liner has pulled back from the toes and the gel bottom feels to be gone. Prior to this, she had the same pair of shoes for 1 year with no issues. As a mother of 4 who doesn't like to spend this much on shoes to begin with, I am very upset. She came home and told me that they were hurting her toes and that the liner was unattached and pulled back. I reached inside and it felt like there was no gel at all at the front of that shoe and the bottom was bare. Unless she wants her toes to hurt daily and fight with the unattached lining, she will need new shoes within the next week. Very disappointing! I have sketchers with no issues and my other children do as well. We are sketchers fans but this particular shoe obviously wasn't made well.
...so I am very happy.<br />No shoe lace is a big plus.
Great pair of shoes can't wait to get another pair!
My daughter claims these are the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn. Too often, children's shoes are not made for comfort. It makes me happy knowing her feet are getting the support they need.
My daughter loves these shoes.  She said it is all she wants to wear because they fit so well and are so comfortable.  Wants me to order the other colors available in this shoe :)
For my grand daughter and she loves them.
Bought for my 5 year old daughter.  They are somewhat wide, but my daughter's feet are a little wide too.  They have a memory foam in them and are &#34;awesome shoes mom!&#34;
My daughter has these shoes and she loves them (kind of). When she has to do athletics, these are her go to shoe and they seem to be comfortable and stylish (we got them muddy once and found them quite easy to wipe off and restore to a reasonable state). My daughter's one complaint (and I don't know if this is valid or not) is that she feels like the velcro doesn't stay tight for her (she's five). She's constantly asking me to tighten the velcro on her shoes. I don't know if this is a fair critique of the shoes or my daughter's idiosyncrasy, but that's my experience with these. Great shoe, velcro possibly gets loose...
My daughter likes it very much!
My daughter loves these. They sparkle, and came with 2 different sets of shoe strings. 1 blue set like the picture, and a pink set. They have good cushion inside, and she says they are comfortable.
Excellent
Excelent
great!
My generally only wears Skechers. She says that these Skechers are different, like she is &#34;walking on a cloud&#34;. They have a very cushy insole so I can see why she says that.  They come with an extra, alternate color shoe lace in case you want to change them to bright pink.
My daughter picked these out and they're so light and cute! They also come with an extra set of shoelaces in pink--which she loved. Great buy!
Bought as a girl for my daughter. She has worn them constantly. While she loved the look, I enjoyed the durability and price.
My daughter loves her new shoes. No they don't light up, but are pretty light for her day to day activities and that's what we wanted. The shoe comes with two choices of shoe laces. Purple and pink with sparkles or some silver color running through them. Of course she had to have the pink with silver sparkles! What girl wouldn't?!<br />These are her day to day school shoes and so far the quality is awesome! Our kids have PE every day at school, so they have been tested for close to a month now and still holding up!<br /><br />Would definitely recommend these!
Awesome
My 8 yr old loves these shoes. Easy to put on. Cute colors.
Very nice sneakers, holding up well so far, on the feet of a little runner.
My daughter likes this shoe. matches most of her dress combo.  Easy to wear in the rush hour to school.
Love these shoes!  This is our second pair of Sketchers (growing feet) for my daughter and they did not disappointment.
These shoes fit my daughter well.  She's very particular (read: she complains a lot) and these shoes seem to be a-okay.  Usually we have had problems with durability of Skechers, but these seem to be holding up.
These shoes are not narrow (in case somebody wants narrow shoes).  They're not super wide either, but my girl has a bit wider feet than normal and these shoes fit so well!  They are very light and super cute.  She said they are very comfortable and &#34;cushy&#34;.
These shoes are very sturdy and cute. I have always preferred skechers to Nikes or any of the other big name brands. I was not disappointed when these arrived for my Daughter. She has been wearing them for about a week now and hasn't voiced any complaints about them. The colors are very vibrant, the soles of the shoes are sturdy and we love that they have velcro and the appearance of laces. These shoes are definitely worth the money!!
My 6 year old daughter loves these shoes.  I have a hard time getting her to wear her dressy shoes and any other shoes since she loves these so much.
My daughter loves these.  The fit is perfect, the colors are great and they are lightweight and comfy.  I loved the awesome price!!
Beautiful than photo.
She LOVES these shoes!
I got a very sincere Thank You from my daughter when these arrived. She hates to wear shoes but these she will wear. She says they are super comfy.
She loves them!
Runs a little small. My daughter wears an 11, bought an 11, and it's difficult for her to put on. She's 4. Should've gone up a size.
These are the cutest shoes, and my daughter says they are super comfortable.
My daughter loves these shoes. Fit well.
They are for my daughter. I don't know about arch support but they are her second pair and she loves them.
Great product.
Love these tennis shoes. My 5 year old is a tiptoe walker and it is difficult to find shoes that do not rub the back of her heel sore. These do the job very well. But the toe of the shoes have worn off due to her walking on her tiptoes. She still wears them as they are very comfortable. But I wish that they were a little more durable in the toe area.
My daughter loves her new memory foam skechers. If they cost less I'd buy them for my twins, but it's too much to spend when feet grow so fast at their age. I would totally recommend. They feel like walking on a cloud she said, and she loves the velcro. My daughter is 9 in 4th grade, and she worried that velcro shoes were babyish at this age and originally demanded laces. Kids nowadays still have so many problems with laces, I wish they made velcro options for us adults. It would surely help out in a Zumba class, lol. But she saw them in person and was delighted by the still age-appropriate look and I don't have to shove her feet into high tops and double knot any longer. The colors are vibrant and srunning.. all the kids love them.<br /><br />Happy child ='s happy mom! Got my own in the same print. Will let you know, but I expect to love them to :).
I am so very disappointed.  I bought these for my granddaughter; she loved the look.  We got this first pair and she wore them 2 times and the bungee cord broke.  I sent them back and got another pair.  She worn them 3 time and the cord broke on these.  We have bought a lot of skechers but these are terrible.  Buyer Beware
Love these. They are so comfortable.  Just need to keep in mind if they are big girl sizes 3.5 is a woman's 5.5 and a big girl 5.5 is about a 7.5
My daughter love it.
Elastic straps broke with in 6 days of wearing them.  I hadn't bought my daughter skechers in over 3 years because they never seem to last. I was hoping their products had improved over time but apparently not, guess we'll try again in another few years.
my daughter loves them!
My daughter loves these for school. Won't wear any other shoe now! I was surprised how light they were and how soft the shoe sole is. Highly recommended!
Great shoes. Both girls love them. I have adult version, the pink tie dye, lots of compliments. Very comfortable.
These shoes started falling apart, and the bungee laces broke after just two days. Very cheaply made.  I had to return them.
very good! my kid likes it.
My daughter loves them, they were a great price, and I didn't have to run around going to stores.
Its only been a few weeks since I bought these shoes for my 6 year old daughter and I am somewhat disappointed.  The Velcro strap has started to fray and the fabric used for the shoe itself has started to frat as well. They look years old rather than. Weeks old.
My daughter absolutely loved these.  She said it felt like she was walking on a cloud.  I'm guessing that means they give good support?!  They're really brightly colored and fun.  I'm hoping these will last her the whole school year.
EXCELENT
Adorable shoes!
So cute. Love all the colors
love them!
We just got these shoes delivered to go with us on a vacation trip and when my 4 year old tried them on, she loved them.  She did not want to take them off.  I felt the cushion on the inside and I am so sure that my daughter will be totally comfortable with all the walking we will be doing.  They are adorable and will match all of her outfits.  Very cute shoe.
Perfect fit, fast shipping, great product
Great
Cute, comfortable shoes!  We love them.
Adorable sneakers. Not easy to mess up either which is a plus.
FINALLY, I found sneaks for my daughter that were not light ups,  which she can't wear to school.  They are cute,  my daughter loves them, they fit good, easy to get on, and were cheap enough for me, a little less than 30 dollars. It took a few months of looking on/ off, but im happy now. So only thing left is seeing how long they hold up...stay tuned!
I ordered these for my granddaughter.  She loves them!  She jumped up and down in them and said that they felt so good.  She loved the sparkly straps.
They're adorable. I think the padding in the bottom is very puffy and a little odd, but it doesn't seem to bother my toddler.  We had these a month and maybe wore 10 times total and the velcro seperated from the strap.  I found this this unacceptable for the money and returned them..
These shoes look good and are light and comfortable. However durability is terrible for a toddler (4 years). Within a week of wearing, the pink color in the front wore off. Now, it has only been 6 weeks and the velcro has separated completely from the strap on one shoe and half of it has separated on the other shoe. Never had these issues with her previous shoes - New Balance KV990 - which we kept replacing every 6 months with the same model whenever she grew out of them. We tried these Skechers for a change, but would not recommend them based on our experience.
Such a cute girly shoe! Light, easy to get on little feet, colors match most things, seem to be really comfortable! A little expensive, but hoping they will hold up for a while. Good purchase!
Happy with my purchase
Great shoe. Good quality. Excellent deal
Great
My daughter loves this sneaker. She is into astrology so this was a perfect gift. They fit her great especially because her feet are wide. Comfort all day. Shipping was quick and packaging was secure.
My daughter has been wearing these lightly for over a month now. They are very comfortable, lightweight and beautiful. The pink painted line has started to come off around the front, but this is not too distracting. She loves the cosmic colours and they came with a spare set of purple laces.
Nice and comfy! Fits true to size. Memory foam is amazing!
They fit perfect
Good shoes, her daughter put it bluntly, very comfortable
Fantastic shoes.<br />I was taking a risk ordering these overseas and ordered another style half size larger but fortunately they both fit well and are very comfortable my daughter says.<br />Excellent service by Amazon
This poem is a good commodity, and the price is very favorable, my daughter very satisfied.
My daughter loves these shoes so much. She said they are super comfortable
My daughter and I bought this and she said it's very comfortable to wear and her feet never gets tired walking aroung or even after running. She said the color is cute and she loves how the color pink, violet and blue compliments each other. I would highly recommend shoes like this. :)
It becomes old very fast.
2nd pair we bought because my daughter grew out of the first pair.
My daughter loved sketchers! They are cute and very durable for a young kid. plus they are super comfy! Love them!
Daughter loves them.
very durable
My daughter loves these shoes.  Nice and light.
My daughter got the black shoes with a pink lining. She loves them due to color & comfort. She has a bad knee and she says these shoes help her run in gym class without pain. She has had no complaints. Our budget is very tight so my four kids usually get stuck with Walmart shoes but this time I splurged.
I love this. It's just what I needed.
Our 6 year old loves these shoes. She has slightly flat arches and tends to have sore feet after wearing shoes for more than a couple hours but these have nice foamy soles that provide soft support for her. She says she's &#34;walking on clouds&#34; and they're her favorite walking shoes.
very softï¼Œhelps i think
Got these for my granddaughter's 5th birthday. She loves them.
My daughter loves these shoes but I don't think she'll wear them more than a couple of months as they run a little small. I will have to buy another pair soon for her.
My daughter loves these shoes. She said that it's like she's &#34;walking on clouds.&#34; The colors are vibrant and match most of her outfits perfectly. We are very pleased with them.
Very good!
My daughter loves these. She says its like walking on air and she wants to wear them every day!
very good product
Got them kind of larger but they are amazingly comfortable !
excelente
Excellent product. Excellent seller. 100 % reliable
MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THESE SHOES AND SAID THEY WERE COMFORTABLE.
I am very disappointed. My daughter wore her shoes to school once, and now they have a hole around the toe area. Will never buy again.
My 8yr old loves these. The color and pattern is even more fun in person. She said the memory foam makes them supercomfortable and &#34;squishy&#34;
My kid LOVES these shoes! She never wants to take them off. If you're thinking about it, just do it. its worth it.
My daughter loves her shoes and they seem to be made well. I ordered a size and a half over what she wears cuz I knew sketchers run small so they fit perfect
My daughter absolutely loves these super cute & super comfy shoes!!
Shoelaces are too small and you end up with not enough room to tie them. Pretty shoe, though and very comfy. Pick up an extra set of laces and you are set.
very good shoe. it fits fine except the color of the sole (pink) gets on your socks.
Great fit!! Daughter loves them!
My little lady loves it, very soft on the inside.
These were for my 6 year old daughter, they are pretty much what we expected.
my daughter had these in smaller size , out grew them and we ordered another pair!!
My daughter loves them and it forces her to tie her shoes.
These shoes are great, they fit just as expected, my granddaughter loves them
Look nice but ruined my daughters socks, didn't thing a name brand shoe would do this but it did
My daughter loves it, It is just perfect.
Super cute and comfortable! Outstanding value at a reasonable price
Perfect fit and soooooo comfy!
These shoes fit and feel great. The memory foam inside makes them so comfortable. I typically wear a woman's size 7 and the kids size 5 fits perfect. They also came with a pair of solid pink laces along with the rainbow ones, which was a nice surprise.
My daughter I loves these! The quality is good I wouldn't say great because they have held up for a bout two months and are a little worn now but they are almost daily.
My 6th grade daughter loves them, so do all her friends. She says they feel very soft and comfortable.
My daughter LOVES them, the colors and the &#34;squishy insole&#34;
We have 2 extremely happy customer's. These are for my 7 year old girl. She literally did not take them off all night after trying them on which never happens. My daughter suffers from a form of authritis unfortunately & the comfort of her shoes are very important. The memory foam is outstanding!! I will absolutely be purchasing more in different colors. I got the colorful tie dye. I wish they had the black/pink in her size here as well because the price was fantastic compared to what I've seen so far.
good
Good
They get dirty to fast and can't wipe clean so ima have to wash them
I bought these for my 7 year old.  She loves them.  They were a little snug when she started to wear them but have stretched a little so they are perfect.  She said they are very comfortable and she has no problems wearing them all day.
These are super cute shoes and my daughter loves them. They are, however, a little tight, which I didn't expect given that she has several other pairs of Skechers.  I think the memory foam bed (which is super squishy and comfy) makes the inside of the shoe feel smaller.  The other small flaw is that after 2 weeks of regular kid use (abuse?), the pink trim on the toe box is already wearing away (to show white).  I bought these for camp shoes (although she is wearing them to school for PE right now), so that's not too upsetting, but this is a likely case of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  These were relatively inexpensive for Skechers, and that seems to be what we got.  But she likes them, so I'm happy.
My daughter loves them. Very comfortable and she thinks they make her run faster. She's excited to wear them, even with all her dresses for school.
i love it.
Great shoes
Bought these for my step daughter a few years ago for school. She liked them a lot, the colors were super cute, she loved the fact that she could just slip them on with not worrying about keeping them tied. She liked the idea of being able to spin on the shoes like a ballerina, but often had troubles spinning. Other than that minor detail she loved them and they were a good sturdy pair of shoes for her.
The shoes fit my daughter perfectly and she loves it.
Bought these for my Granddaughters Birthday. She loves them.
The quality is great but the shoe was the wrong size when they sent it. It was a few sizes too small. It's a hassle to send back so I just kept for my younger daughter to grow into
My daughter is a ballet dancer....she loved these.  She would twirl about everywhere we went because she enjoyed the feeling of spinning and it dulled any level of boredom she faced.  The shoes look really nice and are supportive in the arches as they seem a bit narrow but she never complained.  They held their shape after 1 year of constant wear.  The only thing is the ruffle on the end after lots of wear and tear can get bent or pull back and the sequins do try to work as a lint brush if you have animals in the house. HA!  But, they really held up well for my daughter so even if it doesn't get a 5, I'd give it a 4.5 for looks and enjoyment.
I love plain white sneakers because they match with everything & these are still stylish.
Great
too narrow.  Daughter did not like them
I get a new pair every new school year for my daughter. Her feet are long and narrow, so these fit perfectly!
Nice
Excellent shoes!!!!!
One of these shoes has completely come apart, not at the seams but in two places along toe area.  They have been worn for approximately 3 months.  This has put me right off skechers.
Exclente
My daughter loved it
Thanks
So excited about how cheap I got these on here compared to local stores. They fit great and stood up to a rambunctious 9 year old girl.
Cute.
5 year old adored these, is begging for more.  They were easy to put on.  Didn't hold up as well as i hoped.
My daughter loved these and wore them everywhere! Cute and affordable.
My daughter loves these shoes! They look good, fit great, and go with anything! Perfect for most activities and convenient to just slip on and go! No waiting on her to struggle to tie them! I recommend these shoes for all kids and love all of the different colors/styles they have!
Pretty!!!
Daughter's favorite shoes!
Delicatr
Great quality and super cute on my niece!
Loved these. Great purchase.
Love them fit good and look great.
Very cute shoes.  Ok to be a little bit big for growing room.
Nice shoe and comfortable
nice
So stinking cute!  Ended up running a little large for my daughter. Great quality and comfortable.
Love these. I am 28 years old and only 4'9 with size 2 1/2 shoe. The size 3 obviously were a little.too big but string at back helps. Love them and so comfortable !!!
Perfect fit thank u for the fast delivery
These shoes are really cute on! My daughter likes them a lot. They fit true to size but the more she wears them; they do stretch out a little!
Quality could have been better...runs wide.
Great shoes, very beautiful, fit right and at a great price.
Really cute looking shoe but not sure about the fit.<br />Recommend it.
Love these shoes for my daughter. So cute, seems to run a little small (usually wears a 10 but 11 fit nicely), and goes with everything.
Muy bueno.
Better than picture.  Super cute!!!
I bought a pair of these shoes for my 6-year-old daughter. They are a good price and look good. She likes them.
Great !!!
My daughter loves them she wears then everyday ! :)
most shoes of this type dont have good arch support.  but they are for my 5 year old and she loves them
Runs small. Size up
Good product
Super cute and great price! My only negative comment about these shoes is that they arrived with some of the paint worn off of the little studs. Otherwise, great!
Cool shoes for my 5years daughter ! She like them! So cute and comfortable! True to size!
wanderfull quality
My daughter with sensory issues loves these boots which is HUGE for us! They also provide ankle support & are holding up great to the heavy use (these are her favorite shoes).
Adorable and great buy. Much cutier than expected,
Super cute.  Fits great.  The uneven top of the boot does not bug her in any way.  Very cute.
My daughter loved them and thinks she can use them riding.
I bought these for my 9 year old daughter for an amateur horse riding excursion.  They did the trick, and I got them at a really affordable price!  She had no complaints.
Cute boots but I will never buy from this 3rd party seller again.
Fits well and my daughter says they're comfy.
Our little girl loves them!
My daughter loved these boots!
This is my daughter's second pair. She grew out of the first ones and wanted that bigger size. She's VERY hard on shoes, but that lasted all the way until she grew out of them.  Well made and very supportive ankle.
Shoes are pretty! Daughter love it. However it run 2 sizes small. Got this in U.S. Size 12 but measure the same as my girl's other boots in U.S. Size 10.
daughter loves them
nice boots
Good quality. The size corresponds to the specified. Comfortably seated on the leg. Beautiful.
I applied a decent product.
nice
We love these kicks.
Colors are vibrant and looks good. My daughter loved it. I would have give 5 stars if prints would not fade in a month.
My daughter loves them, true to fit for youth 2. I purposely got a little big she more of a 1.5 but wears such thick socks, so I wanted there to be room and comfort. Now she has both, replaced an older pair, and these are patent so easy to clean! Good price as well. Very happy!
Nice and comfortable. My doughter adore them!
They appear to run 2 sizes larger. Will keep them to grow into.
Both my daughter and I love these boots. Total badass.
Bought these for my 6 year old to wear to go camping. She loves them! Not sure how they will hold up in the long run...if they start to fall apart too soon, I'll be back to update, but so far we love these boots. (Had to come back and give them four stars instead of five, only because the shoe laces will not stay tied!)
5 yr old loves these.  They are waterproof with heavy duty sole and bendable. I'm going to let her wear them for our camping trip.
Logistics needs to be improved, and the packaging is broken, shoes is very good.
My stuff came on time I love how it fits my girls
My daughter LOVES these boots.  So cute, fashionable and she can wear them all day.
very good
Cute, comfortable,  durabl.  Great for outdoors!
I bought it as gift to my nephew, she loves it although it''s too large for her, it's good designed and well made, it seems very abrasion-proof
i like the shoes. but it is a little bit large.
Great looking boot that my daughter loved. We'll have to wait awhile until she can grow into them, they ran BIG!
nice
my kid loves them
Too large
Mydaughter loved these boots!
My son loved these shoes.  He wore them until his toes couldn't squeeze into them anymore.  I would highly recommend this product.
Fell apart in a week
My son loved these when we had these pair of shoes delivered. Exactly 5 days later, lights stopped working one of the shoes and I had to return them. Other than that, this is a great shoe.
My grandson loves them.
My son wears them 4-5 times per weel to school, including phys. ed. and other activities. After about 12 weeks these Skechers held up very well.<br />The negatives. The lights on them went out a while ago. They are pretty heavy weight.<br />The positives. Solid build, comfortable.<br />Maybe a good pair of shoes for colder weather
Mu son loves them!! They are comfortable to him and he weres them everywhere, thankyou
The flashing light on the left shoe has never worked.  It is supposed to have it on the right and the left, but it only has one.  The little guy feels cheated.
Within a week the velcro fastners fell apart on both shoes in the same place. I sewed them back together because my 5 year-old was so in love with the style, but I am very disappointed that such expensive shoes fell apart so easily.
Darling shoes.  They fit my grandson perfectly and he was crazy about them.  I love Skecher shoes.
Skechers makes high quality products, it lasts longer, so if you see they have on sale items, buy and try...
Good
My 4 year old loves them. Quality made and fits well.
Tab came off run small
The shoes were advertised as boys size 5, but they were infants size 5.
Grandson loved them...
Fit as expected. Lights on shoes are cute. 5 year old grandson loves the shoes!
REGULAR
Fit great.. Very soft bottom sole and inside shoe..Lights in three places.. Grandson realy loves them..
My son loves these sneakers.
I personally don't encourage the super hero stuff at home but didn't want to be harsh with my kids at the same. My son loves Spiderman and for his 4th birthday I found these. You should see the joy on his face.... truly priceless. Two birds in one shot. A happy father because it doesn't have super heroes on it and a happy son because it has Spiderman colors and the lights.
My grandson has a high arch and these fit him comfortably.  He loves them.
Tongue seems a bit to small and keeps moving around
Both of my boys have wide feet and Skechers seems to be the only brand of sneakers that can fit them perfectly. The durability on these shoes are great as well.
My son picked these out & he's delighted with them! He has a slightly wider foot and we found that Skecher's fit him well.
my son wears these shoes so I don't know about arch support. Provided that he's a child, the toes of the shoes are worn out
The toe section started detaching after two weeks.
US Size if you read the Size chart = 12US  = 30 EUR but its not, its 12 US 28.5 EUR
Looks good, fits my child well. Loves the lights. Good purchase so far.
My 5 years olds face lit up just like the sneakers!  Good quality, great price. Lights are bright!
My 3 year old loves these shoes!!
My son loves Sketchers because he thinks they make him run faster.  He was so excited about these shoes and even more excited when his best friend got the same pair.  Unfortunately, they didn't hold up as well as I expected, and his friends mom felt the same.  He did wear these more than other shoes, but I always buy a few pairs to rotate through, so they weren't worn everyday, and they only made it through a couple of months.  Usually, his shoes still look pretty good once he's outgrown them, but these didn't even last until he outgrew them.  Will try Sketchers again because he still feels like they make him run faster.  Hope another style holds up better.
Bought them for my grandson. He loved them!
These shoes are the only shoes my son(7)  has worn since last August(2014) and they are finally worn to holes on the bottoms. I'd say I definitely got my money's worth! Will be buying sketchers again.
Very good, lights are a bit too dull, aren't noticeable enough for a kid!
I bought these shoes for my 3 year old son. I purchased them with the intention of being a size bigger because he's growing (some days, quicker). HE LOVES THEM and has no complaints; which, I have no complaints and very satisfied!!!
We always love the light up skechers for our son and he does too! They always fit well and are durable too. Plus they're much cheaper on amazon than in the stores.
Meu filho adorou.
A little too large than I thought.
Seem to wear out fast. Especially faster than the stride rite I bought his twin brother.
Definitely worth the price, no doubt my grandson will out grow them before they wear out.
For my toddler.  He LOVES them.  Sketchers are best pair of shoes for my 2 year old boy who has a chubby feet with a tall instep.  These work great and he thinks they are Spiderman's shoes.
A little big but the shoe is very nice
Very nice
Love them!! He loves the lights, I love the quality!
My 4 year old  loves these shoes and says they are so comfortable so thank you Sketchers.
Excellent
Bought these for my toddler and he loves to watch them light up. They do seem a bit heavy compared to other shoes and he trudges around a bit when walking. They also seem to come off easily which is not fun for me because I have to keep a close eye on them when he is in his stroller.
My son really likes these shoes. He says they are very good for running. He likes the different lights and the diamond design.
I felt that these are a bit heavy weight compared to other light up shoes.
I just bought these shoes for my 6 year old 2 months ago and they have already broke! They strap broke right off! I would expect a better quality from Skechers.
Arrived.  Fits great.
It Is very strong
lasted for a long time but not as long as the first ones we had gotten
I think this shoe should be made in WIDE to provide more room.  The material of the shoe is not breathable, therefore providing a wider fit would be more comfortable.
He loves those shoes! Great feature with lights that can be turned on/off.
excelente
the shoes were awesome for about a month.. they started to scuff and wear in pretty quick after that.  Also the front toe lights on the right foot will not turn off even after we push the on/off button.  this has caused the rest of the lights to drain. it has been on constantly for at least a month now.
Literally the Only pair of shoes that my son has not tore up within a month. These things are very sturdy and quality built. Feels like a steel toed boot! He had them for about 6 months before outgrowing them. They still look great after 6 months of abuse, with no issues or rips/tears/holes or anything. Very good pair of children's shoes. You won't regret the purchase!
I purchased these shoes about 6 months ago. Today, my son managed to snap the strap right off the shoe. The material used isn't very strong if a 5 year old can pull it off the shoe. :/
I bought these for my 6-year old at a local store right around Christmas. They do not breathe at all, and his feet sweat like crazy.  After only about 4 months of wear, the camo panel is torn and not repairable, and pieces of the sole are peeling off. I bought them thinking that they would be sturdy and wouldn't wear out as quickly as they have. Kind of disappointed in Skechers quality lately.
These shoes did not last very long.
This is are 3rd pair. They hold up really well. My son has CP and can really do damage to his shoes. These are like iron and he said they are comfortable.
After three months of light wear the soles are coming apart, and the light sensor is about to come out of the bottom of the shoe.
Was great for a month until one of the shoes lights wouldn't turn off and stayed on constantly. I can't get it to turn off, and just have to wait for the power to run out.
My son LOVES the shoes. Though one shoe's lights come and go...but he doesn't seem too upset.  Really like the look of them too.
My son absolutely loves them. He is very hard on shoes but these are very rugged and a perfect fit for him!
Shoes fit great. My son loves them and they are holding up well.
Love these shoes! Our son was burning through Nikes about every 3 months and then he fell in love with light up shoes. Thank goodness because these shoes have held up amazing! Though the lights on our first pair stopped working after about 6 months but I also should have turned them off from time to time. These shoes are so durable!
My son loves these shoes, I've ordered them twice now, because he wore the other ones out and didn't want to wear any other ones!
Fell apart at the toes the stiching  poorly done
I love sketchers, they are my favorites and my grandson loved these shoes . HOWEVER !  They only lasted 6 weeks......Here is the problem that everyone has had.... The toe is made of a very thin rigid piece of plastic and where the stitching goes across it, it weakens it at  the stitchline and the plastic breaks.  After 6 weeks of 5 year old wear, the plastic did brake all the way across the toe and we were shopping for new shoes again.  What a waste of money, time and what was a really fun shoe that had the potential of a repeat buy.  Don't waist your money.
Fell apart in two months.
Our first few pairs of Skechers were so tough that we told everyone how great they were... But our last few pairs, including these, have no held up well at all. They were cool looking, while they lasted.
Agree with all the bad reviews and warnings. Shoe completely fell apart after less than two months. Disgracefully low quality, should receive less than one star.
but the light was broken,I think it was ufsafe
Comfortable... as far as my 7-yr-old tells me.  BUT - they lasted less then 2 months. These shoes were delivered on March 12th - today, is May 12th - I purchased new pair of sneakers for my son over a week ago.  The entire top mesh of the sneaker came apart!  It is difficult to describe... it's not that the stitching is bad, but I think the mesh fabric is rotten, or something.  It's not like the soles got chafed off... so I really don't understand how this happened??!!  These were my son's &#34;school&#34; shoes.  Yes, boys will be boys - but he still cannot ruin shoes from sitting in a classroom in less then 2 months.  TERRIBLE QUALITY!!!  Shame on you &#34;Sketchers&#34;!!  Both my husband & son always wear sketchers shoes and sneakers - this is very disappointing.
My grandson LOVED lights!  they soon got stuck on and didn't flash anymore when he walked. that was disappointing to him
I bought these shoes on Amazon because I had already bought my son a pair at double the price and they broke apart after a while of using them. He likes these shoes and won't wear anything else but I just couldn't see myself paying more than $50 for shoes that are going to crack and break at the toe. Since I bought them they finally came apart and I hot glued them back together. Other than this design flaw these shoes are great. I just wish they were made sturdier.
After worn for just 2 weeks at school and dry weather, it shows wear like stitches came off and glue peeling. Disappointing.
Perfect as expected shipped fast
My son loves that he can change the color and turn it off when he is at school or church.  He said they are very comfortable, he never wants to take them off!
I bought these shoes for my son and he has worn them for 3 weeks. after that they completely destroyed.<br />it is low quality..
My son put these on and wouldn't take them off. He loves them! I love the look of the translucent sole and they are pretty lightweight. The cool feature in my 6 year old son's eye is, each shoe lights up a different color (one blue, one red). All in all a great shoe. I always stick with Skechers.
my son loves these shoes
My six year old loves them !
Comfortable good looking excellent value what more do you need????
Great shoe & price! Thanks!!!!
Not all the lights worked.
My kid loved them.
Shoes are adorable but fit smaller than size!
Shoes fell apart in less than two weeks. They look sturdy but they are made of cheap paper like material.
My son has only worn these shoes for about 6 weeks, and they already look terrible.  The color on the S logo started coming off the first day he wore them, and the toes on both shoes are coming apart.  He loves the lights and says they're comfortable, but I would expect them to hold up better for the price.  He's had other Skechers that held up very well so I was surprised at how quickly these started falling apart.
Awesome shoes, light up like no other light up shoes I've seen. Fit well and seem to be good quality, I guess we'll see how they hold up.
I was surprised there are different color lights on each shoe, but they are very nice. One shoe has a blue or green choice. The other has a choice of red or yellow.
I like them!!!
My son loves the shoes but he hasn't even worn them a month and they already are split open above the toe area.
good
We got this because my son wants them.
My 7 year old grandson loves them even if the on/off- color changing button doesn't work (only 6 days after we got them).!
So fun! My three year old loves changing the colors of the lights. Great quality.
Horrible. Have lasted not even 2 weeks. They are coming apart at the top. Bad quality. Do not buy!
Great Shoes!!!!
Excellent shoes!!!!!
excellent product, excellent service
Strong shoe. Fits well and looks good. Very good product. My grandson is wearing it over seven months now and it is still going strong
My son wears these all the time, even in the hot desert he'd rather wear these than sandals.  Must be comfortable!
the kid loves them.
Nice fit, seems very comfortable.
OK
Lasted the whole school year (really, i swear). They are starting to show signs of wear, but lets face it. he's 5, he's a boy, and he's always on the move. Any time I can more than a few months out of shoes for my little guy, I'm a happy mommy.
my 8 year old doesn't want to wear any other shoe he wants a black one now to match his other pants
Great buy!
Perfect
Excellent
good
my kids love to wear these
even though my son has only been wearing the to school for 2 months the front is already falling apart.
thank you
The only problem with these shoes was that the Velcro strap on one of the shoes is sewn on upside down so the strap is unusable.  I have to send them back, but I reordered a new pair in hopes that the strap on these next ones are ok.  Otherwise my son really liked them.
my son hated them - really uncomfortable, wore them once, and returned.  (He usually doesn't even flinch when he puts on a new pair of shoes, so I knew these truly were uncomfortable.)
Excelente
Fit as expected. This was a gift for my lil brother and he really loves it.
Not the prettiest shoe ever but my child was ripping through shoes like crazy. I needed  to get a tougher shoe so I thought skate shoes might work and I am pleased with the durability.
Very nice-looking, solid shoes....
My son loved these!  They hold up pretty good!
excelente
son loves look of shoes but after what maybe 6 wears the red rubber bottom of shoe is peeling off everywhere.  These are not holding up like our sketchers of the past.
I need a boot made with regular leather and either velcro or a zipper up the side for my 10 year old. All the junk Chinese shoes out there, He just trashes them too quick. Of course they need to be affordable and last a long time!
My grandson loves them cuz they're just like daddy's.
Fit as I expected for my 10 year old.
Good quality boots and my son loved them! He calls them his army boots.
These shoes are what we needed for my son's dance class. He actually really liked them and wants to wear them all the time.
Fell apart after minimal wear. Sending back!
Love them
My 7 yr. old son loves these military style boots. He uses them while running, biking, and hiking on rocky and rough terrain. The easy on side zipper is an excellent feature. So far, they have held together and done their job of protecting his feet while providing superior traction. Highly Recommend!
Got this for my boys, they love it and wear them to school all day without any complaints.
As description
Perferct.
My son loves them.  He is ALWAYS telling me how comfy they are.
These shoes are great for my son who walks really hard on his heels, the extra  cushion  helps.
Nice
My son loves these shoes!  The memory foam cushion feels great, he doesn't complain about walking in the mall.
Light weight but run big.
I've bought it for my 10yrs scholar son. They  overcome with honours all tricks of teenage fortune includes rock soccer,  jumping, running and so on. No  scratches, tears or outsole damage. This year I've ordered another one and hope they will be not worse than previous.
Bought these for my 5 year old son. Tried on in store before purchasing so I knew what size to order. He loved them! Wants to wear them all the time.
Excelent, Fast shiping
they run a little bit smaller than the average. try a half a size up from your normal if you can. might be better to try some on at a store then  buy them here once you know how they fit
An excellent choice for young, active boys who need &#34;dressy&#34; shoes in addition to sneakers.  Great find and a good price.
Shoes slipped on the heels.
Very comfortable although the size runs a bit small.
This is the second time I buy these for mu child. Tottaly recommended
One of the velcro closures has already split apart.  Otherwise, my 5 year old loves them.
I've been buying Stride Rights for my son, they seem a little snug in M width.  These one are a little more roomy & easy to get on & off.
These shoes have been great for my now 22 month-old.  They are lightweight and slightly wider than other brands, which is perfect for my little one's fat little feet.  He seems to be comfortable in them and he doesn't trip over them like he does with other, heavier shoes.  Its great that they are machine washable too but, my son has grown out of his well before they are even close to dirty so I have yet to wash them.
Love theses shoes! They are lightweight, flexible, breathable fabric, and machine washable. It's a Moms dream. They are perfect for my 1 year old. Love the price too.
sent back they were toddler size, NOT young adult.
I was expecting it to be bigger in size. but because of the very cushioned sole, it made the shoe smaller. Fortunately for me, I had wanted to buy one size larger to store as his next shoe. I took out for him to try and it fits him just nice now.
good
My boy's size10.5W shoes are becoming too short. As a wide-foot boy, He needs to wear half a size larger for normal width. So I order size 12 this time,they come out not as loose as I thought. My boy and I love them
ALL GOOD EXCELLENT SELLER
excllent one
There are way too many different prices and odd sizing on here. The shipping is definitely NOT 2 days. I got mine 5 days later and am pretty uspet considering i wanted these for a certain occasion. They are very lightweight shoes made mostly of mesh, so not for hard playing.
I bought 2 pairs for my 2 boys. Within a week of use (both of them go to preschool/elementary), there are holes in the toe cap - I guess the shoes are too comfortable for my boys to wear and run around with. The search for durable shoes continues...
Good shoe for the money, seems comfortable but very &#34;meshy&#34; sides. Expect dirty socks because everything gets through. It's hard to find good boy shoes,  so as long as he's comfortable I can deal with the dirty socks.
Nice sneakers  .My son loves them.
Great Shoes!
These are great sneaks for a new walker/runner.  They have a very cushiony insole.
Have a little bit of a &#34;flimbsy&#34; feel to them, but that doesn't make them junk.  We'll see how long they last.  Most Skechers my boys can wear for a yr+ (if they wouldn't out grow them.  LOL!)  LOVE the way they flex and they are so light, yet have great support in them!  Makes them a great running shoe which is why we chose them.  Nice option if you don't want to pay the $60+ for good running shoes yet.
perfect shoes.
This shoe strap was easily pulled off after about two times if wearing.  It was pulled off by my 2 yr old!
These shoes are very nice,  but size is not accurate.  My son wears a size six and his feet are a little fat.  So I would order 1 or 2 sizes bigger.
My son wears these shoes more than any others in his closet.  They are comfortable for him (he is very picky about his shoes), and they look good too.  I would recommend sizing up at least a half size.  My son wont be able to wear these for too long because there isn't much wiggle room.
very nice.
Overall, these sneakers are great.  They fit our son well, look great, and are lightweight.
Awesome
They run a bit small. Choose a half to whole size bigger.
Tighter fitting than expected
Love these shoes and so does my 3 year old. It's light weight, machine washable, and has memory foam. I love it's breathable material. My boys feet can get funky with other shoes. No complaints ðŸ’•
Cute, fit as expected and love the fact there machine washable.
My child loves it, as soon as i unpacked the shoes he inmediatly request me to put them on, he has a smaller size of this tennis before and it is great, also the foamy insole is great
My 2 year old love this shoes. They are very comfortable. He loves running with them.
They were too small and they were the wrong color
Kid loves his new shoes
I feel in general, kids Skechers sneakers run large, which I like.  Both my daughter and son have had Skechers the last 3+ years. My son measures at a size 13 so I bought a 1 and he has a full thumb's width for growing room. He says they are the &#34;most comfortable shoes ever!&#34; The memory foam is great and the sneakers fit well.
Great shoe. Light and comfortable
Perfect and he loves it
Perfect for my son. He LOVES the fit. They are on the wide side, but my son has wide feet so that works out perfectly for us. Cute colors (that hide dirt well) and convenient straps.
Great shoes my son loves them. They are light and the memorary foam is perfect.
My son loves these shoes!
Great shoe my boy loves them very comfy
I purchased these shoes in size 2 for my 8 year old son. They are a perfect fit. He likes the way they look and feel. He tries to wear them everyday.
Great
my almost 6 year old very picky son loves these shoes. the inside is very cushiony. I recently bought him two other pairs of skechers which he loved until he got these. These are now his favorite pair of shoes. Just ordered another pair in a size up to save when he outgrows these.
My 5 year old grandson tried the shoes on and took off running to see if they actually made him go faster. He said &#34;Aww they don't work&#34;. He ran again and like magic, in his mind, they started working!  So he's satified and that's all that matters.  Lol
My son loves it. He was very happy when we gave it to him. Thank you
Great shoes.  Cushioned, Velcro closure, fit perfectly.  My 6 year old loves them.
My son opened the box and immediately put the shoes on. He smiled and said &#34;They are like walking on clouds&#34;. So glad I made this purchase for him. These shoes have a lot more padding than the cheap shoes.
excelente
My kid loves these shoes.
My son loves his new shoes! He thinks they make him jump higher :) Also they are easy for him to put on quickly without him mashing down the heel of the shoe. Hopefully they will last at least 6 months without falling apart.
My son loves these shoes. They fit good and he is ready for a new school.
My son loves these shoes. He says the memory foam is so comfy.
My son loves these.  He believes they make him jump higher.  It makes him happy, so I'm happy too.
Very Happy with purchase.
Nice sturdy shoes. Cool design and color
My son loves these!
My son has had these for a few months. They still look good! Granted he doesn't spend a lot of time outside but still...<br />He says he likes them.
Nice my grandson likes them very much.
My son LOVES these shoes and says they are super comfy!
Excellent!
Bought a pair for my 4yr old, who absolutely loves it. He did however thought they had springs that would help his bounce when he jumped. Not quite so. They also fit close. The look great too!
Very good shoes, my son loves it.
Received the shoes and I was very happy. I'm ordering another pair!!  Its hard to find Velcro shoes in the bigger sizes.  My son is disabled and can't tie his shoes so these are a lifesaver!!  He's gotten lots of compliments on the looks also.
Sketchers are a household favorite brand for sneakers.  My son particularly likes the z strap, easy on and easy off.  He's always happy when he gets a new pair!
My son is very hard on shoes and once again this brand is holding up wonderfully. Very pleased.
Very light and cushioned. My son loves it.
Perfect!  Kid loves them.
Work great my 7 year old loves them.
Good shoe for my speciall needs 9 year old.  IT's easy for him to pull the strap and tighten the shoe, and it stays that way.  Also pretty rugged.  Avergae life of shoes with my son it two months.  Lets see if this beats the record of 3 (Those were velcro Roos.)
Returned shoes. Too small. But skecher shoes are really good so giving it 5 stars.
My grandson loves how comfortable they are.
Son loves! We love Skechers at my house! They last and are comfortable. I'm not sure if the description said or not because if it did I missed it, but these have memory foam. My last Skeechers also had memory foam and they are very comfortable.
My grand son love these.  He doesn't have to lace them up.
My Grandson just loves his shoes  he says there comfortable  thank you
My son (age 5)  loves them. They fit well and the insole is pretty thick due to the foam. I would recommend a half size up. He says it's like walking on pillows.
My son hasn't complained, so there's that! ;-]
My grandson loves these. They got perfectly.
Great shoes...very comfortable...my grandson loves them so much I bought him another pair, different color.
Got these for our grandson. Fit good and he really likes the design.
I love these shoes for my child
The sneakers were nice but I got it $10 cheaper at Ross but could not be bothered to return this.
Very disappointed in the sole of the shoe.  Worn down only after 2 weeks of full time wear.
Third pair we bought for our grandson. Not because they wore out, but his foot is growing like a weed in your lawn. Good shoe and holds up very well for super active boy.
Loved these and he still wearing them!!
My son has two pair of skechers shoes. These are his favorite and most comfortable.
The rubber from the bottom is falling off after 2 days. I am sending them back. They are cute, comfortable and he loves them.
The shoes are for grandson, he loves them and they are a very good quality, for little boys 8 yrs. old are hard on shoes.
Nice Shoes!
.  I highly recommend it
My son likes it & it's comfortable. Kinda bigger size compared to other shoes that is same size. However, the silver line started to wear off after a week of wearing it. But doesn't matter because it's a minor issue.
very good
nice
nice and good price
Do not Buy!!! My son loved these sneakers! They are comfy but the black came off the sides and the shiny part turned purple. My husband couldn't find my sons shoes because the color made him think they were my daughters! Do not waste your money. I bought at a store because I was out shopping and my son was curling his toes in prior sneakers. But this is why I shop on Amazon. So I can read reviews and great for returns. These sneakers are 3 weeks old and I am terrible about saving receipts.
Such well designed shoes! My grandson just loves how they look and feel. That says a lot, coming from a 5 year old.
My grandson loved them an it's the right size
Bought for our 3 yr old son, he loves them.  The strap makes it so he can take them off and put them on himself.  He is very rough on shoes and these seem to be really well made, they fit him well and seem to feel good on his feet.
He loves his new shoes.  Says they are comfy and light.  Overall win win here!!!
Typical sketchers. They hold up about as well as a pair of shoes can for a 7yr old boy. They fit well. I'll be pleased if I can get 5 months of use out of them.
My grandson loves these shoes.  Still only a couple of weeks old so don't know how it will hold up to his hard and rough play.
great shoe
Nice colors-- bright and colorful. The fit is great and easy to put on. Great for an active 5 year old. Good for wide feet, might be slightly too wide for narrow feet. Overall great shoe and fit.
grandson loved them for first day of Kindergarten
my kid really likes them.  and I returned 2 other pairs of shoes before we found the right ones.  They have to be super comfortable for him and fit just right, these are perfect for us.
great shoes, my son loves them
My kid loved these. Put them on and immediately challenged his friends to a foot race! Nice shoes and they look sharp!
5 year old nephew love these...
he was very pleased fit well
My kid loves them.
My son love it.
My son loves them. He says they're very comfortable.
These are great shoes! My son wears them every day and they still look as good as new!
They fit well and seem to be rather sturdy.  They've lasted a month with no holes or wear and they look really nice as well.  That's a pretty good start with my kid.  Hoping they last through the summer!<br /><br />FWIW, according to my 4 year old son they make him run faster and jump higher.  I have not yet confirmed this data.
Exactly what I expected.  My son loves these shoes!  Not sure why the store didn't have half sizes but I'm so glad Amazon had them!!!!!  He loves how these shoes look and I do too!
Great
i bought these shoes for my grandson there are great
Nice fit and look, but one month into this pair all the color elements are faded or scratched off. Raised portions are peeling back. Inside back heel is creasing.  Not good quality at all.  And this isn't an area where there was wet weather to deal with....they shouldn't be so damaged after a month, especially at the price.
These are for my grandson to start school in.
Perfect shoes. Broncos represent ;)
Shoe is a great fit, true to size. We had a similar style before this that also lasted a good time.
Fit a little large but not where we needed to return. Just means they will last a little longer!
Good but a little big
Awesome shoe for awesome kid. Also has all of his favorite colors - can wear with all of his neon shirts.
Light weight, sturdy, and comfortable fit.
Happy boy!!!
Son likes and wears every day.  They look good and hold up well over time.
Fits food grandchild loves them
Durable and my preschooler has no complaints.
Good shoes.  He is hard on shoes and goes through a couple of pairs per school year.  They fit well and hold up well.
It wasn't too large, the shoes will last him longer and will grow into them so it's not a problem.  He loves the shoes
Fit as expected. The shoes were very light weight. Very nice!
Excellent
Fits great. Light weight. After 2 months the rubber stated to separate from the toe. Not durable!
My son loves these sneakers! Sketchers has always been one of our favorite brands because it delvers comfort, style and durability. These sneakers prove to deliver the same standards I have come to expect from such a great brand. I love the charcoal/red color combination. These are comfortable and can be worn all day without any foot pain. The fit is excellent, exactly what I expected. I like the velcro latch a lot since it gives the sneaker a sport feel. These are very well made sneakers, they are durable and I can tell the material will last a long time like other Sketchers I have bought in the past. Very satisfied.
Excellent product, reliable seller, highly recommended and delivers the product at the date indicated
my active boys have yet to destroy this pair of shoes! and they tell me that they can run faster in them ;-)
Fit was great
fits right away
my 6 year old grandson loves these sneakers....says they are cool.
My 4 year old son loved these shoes and has worn them out.  They are lightweight and easy for him to put on by himself.
They are very good shoes.  They are a little large only because I got the wrong size.  Otherwise I was very impressed with them.
Great shoe. We have had no issues and my son loves the way they look.
My son loves them.
my nephew loved it
My son says he can run faster because these shoes feel light on hi feet.
My son said he likes it but to stiff and hurting his foot
They feel somewhat &#34;cheap&#34; and<br />Lightweight, like they probably won't last very long. But great buy for the money.  My little guy outgrows his shoes faster than he can wear them out so, works for us!
I just love Sketchers!! They are the only brand of shoes that will stand up to my rough 4 year old son. Plus they look so cool!! Amazon has the best prices on Sketchers shoes.
Very nice.  I bought them for my son to wear to school.  They match his uniform.
My son LOVES his new shoes!
My son loves this shoes and he chooses only this shoes since he receives.
My 8 yr old son runs around all day in these shoes. red and yellow are nice
my son love the shoes, comfortable and the color is beautiful.
My son loves them because they look just like sonic the hedgehog shoes lol. Shipped quick and fit perfectly.
Sketches always a winner
I was happy to find that Skechers is making the lightweight memory foam shoes for kids. Most children's shoes are heavy, hard and unsupportive. We are happy with these!
Smooth as a baby's butt.
My son loves these shoes!!!
Son loves them. Says they are very comfortable. Has worn them only 2 weeks so cannot comment on their durability. Love the colors.
I bought these for my son and he says they are comfortable, really loves the memory foam! But, the blue has already started to scuff off of the top of the toe box. Oh well, he is rather hard on shoes.
I like the shoe, I do wish they had better arch support in them, like many people I have a very high arch and need a strong support for them.  If you could build a shoe like this with strong long lasting arch supports and a good pad for the heel area I'm sure people would snatch them up as fast as you could make them, I know I would.
good
My son recently learned to tie his shoes and was very excited to get a pair of &#34;big boy&#34; sneakers.  I gave him a few choices and he picked these.  He loved the red color and they were on sale, so I ordered them.  They are much cuter in person.  The red isn't quite as orangey as it appears online, and the bright laces are fun.  So far, he is loving them.  Our other Skechers have held up well, and I am hoping these get us through 6 mos. or so.  Not bad for about twenty bucks!
My son loves these shoes. He repeated &#34;they are soooo comfy&#34; for days after getting them.  The color is true to the pictures.
My seven-year-old reports these are very comfortable. He loves that he has memory foam in his sneaks, just like Dad's.
These shoes are great.  They will go with anything.  They also have the memory foam in them and a great arch support.  My 8 year old grandson loves them.
Perfect shoes outstanding service!!!
Our son loves how they feel.
ordered for my son, fit perfect he loves them.
I purchased them for my ten year old son and he was very pleased. They are great looking shoes and my son claims them to be the most comfortable pair he has ever owned.
Great shoe for my grandson.  He really liked them and wears them a lot.  I had him try these because of the gel insole for cushioning and he liked it.  But, we could only find the black ones on Amazon -- all in the stores are brightly colored and no good for school.
Very comfortable
My son loves these shoes. Says they feel great.
Great fit, adequate packaging for shipment.
It is very comfortable and look good, my son is happy with these sneaker
This is the second pair I purchased for my Grandson, he will only wear the Skechers with the memory foam!
comfy shoe
My son loves the memory foam
My 7yr old son loves them!!!!
I bought these for my son who is a size 4 1/2 he loves them however they cane with sticky grayish white stripes on the bottom of the shoes, at least it's on the bottom and not visible to the eye.
My son wanted these so badly.  He loves them.  He says they are so very comfortable.  He is already talking about his next pair when he outgrows these.  He wears them all day at school and says he feet feel great!
very comfortable my son love it, now he loves it so much that he wants another one.
Shoe is great quality. Size was a little larger than expected.
Excellent
Great shoes and much better price than retail stores.
My son loves these shoes. The padding is nice in a kid's shoe.
My son loves them!
Great sneakers but super heavy for a kids feet
My 5 year old says he can jump higher with them, lol. Great quatlity!
Great shoes and price!
My son loves so did I especially because I didn't have to tie shoe laces, a little bit heavy not s problem though!
gooe shoes, would buy again.
Good
My son has a bit of a wide foot. Finding shoes that fit can be hard. These are a perfect fit! They are sporty and cute, they fit nicely, and most importantly they can withstand my 4 year old! This is the second pair of these that we have purchased. When he outgrew his old ones, we immediately bought them in the next size :) I highly recommend them!!!
Soft and squishy!  Not the best arch support but even comfy without socks!
My 12yr old son has always worn Vans or Converse, so this was a new style for him.  As soon as he put them on, he couldn't believe how light these were.  They quickly became his favorite shoes.  I wish Skechers made the style that &#34;looks&#34; like they lace up, but are really slip-on for boys...that would make getting ready for school SUPER FAST!
good!
ok
This is the second pair of these that I have bought for my son. His foot is a little ride and these fit him perfectly. Not to mention, they are absolutely adorable on him! I love the bright colors and they are very cute on. They fit as expected and I have bought them in several other colors as well. I would DEFINITELY recommend them!
I had tried to compare sizes with what we have in the UK and even though I selected what I thought was a best fit, turned out to be still too big. There seems to be a mismatch between sizes on UK shoes and U.S. Shoes. We have to use it now with a shoe pad in. Otherwise it's great.
My 7 year old son wore these for 3 weeks. There is a 3&#34; tear on the front side of the shoe, seriously garbage!!!  They go in the trash tomorrow, and I won't be purchasing skechers again.  They never last long, but 3 weeks is absolutely ridiculous. Disappointing to say the least..
Worst shoes...ever. Top cloth ripped within 3 days . These are boy shoes. And they are expected to be active. Boy comes back home with a ripped shoe... Unbelievable! Waste of money. Comfortable
My son loves them, but the material is fraying on the second day. They are comfortable, although the long-term durability may be questionable.
I'm a 60+ woman who has found her walking shoes!  Boys shoes are wider, and therefore more comfortable.  Love them!
They lasted three months. He has been wearing them only at school. His big toe is showing off now:(
Blue color comes off very quickly after just a few hours of wear. Son likes them but they have quickly started to deteriorate.
espectacular
Good fit
I ordered these for my grandson and he absolutely loves them.  They arrived in two days.  Sure beats taking a seven year old to several shore stores.
My son loved these shoes and wore them everyday.  They developed holes in the toe area within two months of wearing.  I am buying him something a bit more substantial.
Excelente
The first day he wore them they came home smelly, no amount of washing or shoe spray seems to be able to get the stink out of these shoes. It is a problem we have run into with some other brands (merrells trail glove) as well but not every pair of  running shoes he has. Because of the smell issue we will not be buying this particular shoe again. That being said other than the smell they seem to be a good quality pair of shoes. Well crafted and comfortable.
Great!
Great shoes. My son loves them.
These are nice shoes and held up average on my active 7 year old. They lasted about 6 months before he busted a hole through the toe on the right shoe. He did say they were comfortable, but the laces are really, really long (so had to be tied often when not double-knotted).
Nice light weight running shoe for the active kid.  My son is very hard on shoes, these lasted longer than expected.  They are vibrant and very stylish.  The no- skid no-squeak sole make then great for boys who like to skate, slide and scoot along any surface.  The toe will show signs of wear first for kinds who play and the floor a lot, but they never ripped open.  My son loves the snug fit the laces gave over the strap type shoes.
My 11 year old son loves these shoes because the feel &#34;bouncy&#34; and hold up as he runs through the mud. He also played indoor soccer wearing them and felt nimble.
grandson loves these shoes, says they don't make his feet hot.
My son can wear these daily without issue.  He is very hard on shoes and these have stood up well.
These are great sneakers!  My very active son has been wearing them for months and they still look great and feel comfortable!
gGreat running shoe.
great
Grandson loves them
very good. I like skechers , so my son also should be.
My eight yr old LOVES these shoes. We had the go run sketchers before & even with additional inserts due to being flat footed, he says these feel like he's walking on air. And OMG, do they GLOW!! Coolest shoes EVER!!
Nice sneaker! My grandson likes them. They are true to size.
I love them!
My son LOVES how these shoes glow! They're comfortable, cute, and we even just washed them and they came out clean and still in good condition.
My son loves these!  They glow in the dark and fit great.
Great shoe. Wish they had a Velcro. They really glow very bright.
Good
My 8 year old grandson loved these shoes.  They glow in the dark and they were a big hit at school.  We have had a lot of rain here in East Texas and the ground has been saturated.  The shoes became muddy, but I just rinsed them off and they dried quickly as the shoe did not become saturated with the water.  They were good to go the next morning.  They are great.
My son loves these sneakers!
Awesome fit so comfortable to workout in
My son put the sneakers on and loved them instately, saying how comfortable they are.
Ok sneaker but not for colder months. Mesh outside
My son likes the look and colors, but I do not like the quality at all.  They are so light that they felt like Styrofoam.  Within two months holes were developing on the sole.  Poor quality, high price.
My son says these are very comfortable.
shoes look nice but size runs small
Our local school colors are black and orange and my 10 year olds favorite color is orange as well. He loved these shoes from the time they arrived and wears them daily with no complaints to me about them. They were pricey to me as I have 4 children & we try to stay under budget which usually end up meaning Walmart shoes. This time I went above and beyond hoping they last for us!
Great shoes
8 year old daughter loves them....fits true to size and not narrow.  I can clean them easily.
Bought these for my Grandson. Very nice shors, light weight,  bright colors. He loves them!
I was able to get two of these pairs of Skechers for my son for $30.  They have been a great bargain at that price and he wears them a lot. They are lightweight
I received these within 2 days and my grandson loves them. I'm very happy with mgt purchase.
Good school shoes for my son.
very light
Nice for the kids and looks great. The bottom is soft and kid runs faster and longer than ever.
super light weighted . have not wear them yet and hope they can last 2 seasons.
Good shoes a lot more light weight than expected but I bought the sz 2s and they fit him fine not sure how long the will last though.
I'm very happy
Loved the shoes nice style
My son loves these shoes - sooo cool!
Size ran smaller then other sketchers
My son loves them, the only issue is he has really wide feet so we've had issues in the past. These actually do fit him pretty well once we worked through the best way to open up the laces to get his feet in.
It's lightweight.
So far, so good. My 6 to son is very hard on shoes. We have spent a ton on tennis shoes and tried many different brands. I have to say these have held up well so we far. He likes the bright colors and I like that they don't show dirt and wear as much as some of the others.
My son really likes these.  They are lightweight; however, I find the tread to be more like foam and not rubber.  This might not be the shoe to wear to school when it rains and definitely not in snow.  A good summer shoe though.
Retuned. Feel like they are too thin along the sides. I would think water/snow would come through in no time!! They look nice but not a everyday shoe. If my son was just using them for running, it would be different.
Very light and comfortable
Good looking shoes! sturdy but not heavy. They have nice arch support. My son really like these shoes.
My son loves these and has warn them to the ground.  They've been great.  I might ave to purchase a second pair.
So far so good but only worn a few times.
I bought these shoes for casual wear, not running. I am glad I didn't expect to run in them. I tried a quick jog and after a quarter of a mile, I could feel the shock up my legs. The picture is accurate and the gunmetal/blue is a turquoise color. I would recommend these for general wear, but not as a dedicated shorts/running shoe.<br /><br />Pros: very lightweight, nice looking<br />Neutral: little to no arch support (for me a con, for those more flat-footed, a pro)<br />Cons: not enough padding for running
My 7 year old likes &#34;everything&#34; about these shoes!  They are lightweight and comfy.  Since they have breathable sides, they are good for the summertime.
My kids love these. I think Sketchers run about 1/2 a size small.
My son loves these sneakers.
very good
Great
A gift that was loved!
My son loves his sneakers. They fit him perfectly. I hope they last through the season.
They're really nice! My son loves them.
I was so excited to get these for my 5 year old because he loves sketchers, I ordered a size 12 but was very disappointed when we got em. They are not true to size, his last sketchers are a size 11 and are bigger than these.
Comfortable
My son loves these shoes and can wear them comfortably all day.  We bought them a half a size big (since his size was out of stock), but he is zooming around in them.  They are his new favorite shoe.
good
SÃºper hermosas
True to format Sketchers.  Just what my son wanted.  He has worn Sketchers for several years and he usually outgrows them before he can tear them up.
Bought these for my 4 year old when he started basketball lessons.  The price was great - I hate spending over $20 for a pair of shoes my kids will outgrow in 3 months or ruin in the mud.  He says they are really comfortable and he loves the colors.  He likes that they tie (big kid shoes) and I like that the velcro keeps them tied. They do take some work to get on.  He can't do it without my help.
Good for the price.
Excellent
My son loves them! They are really sturdy, especially in the heel area and sole. Look great, just as the photos show. This model does seem a little more narrow in the toe box than a typical boys skechers shoe.
Good shoes
good price .. and look nice
Great shoe. Good quality. Has lasted very well and my son says its very comfortable.
True to size and look really nice.
SUPER!
Very nice shoes. My grandson loves them. Great fit. Great look. Thank you.
The elastic bands broke first day .  :(
Great looking shoe. Definitely an eye catcher in blue and red. Comfortable too. Although runs a bit small by half a size.  Update: The shoe uppers have developed holes within a month of usage.
My son complained that these hurt his feet so he wouldn't wear them.
Very good!
My ten years old son loves the shoe!
My son wears the shoes all day with no problems.
Got a size 1 for my 6, almost 7 year old.  With the cleats and thicker socks, these fit perfectly (he wears a 13.5 shoe).  He loves them, they look great, look brand new after one season. Would buy again
My son complains that they are too high for him . I noticed he does not walk well in them
Fits great, not as narrow as most.
Bought these for my grandson for soccer. He said they feel fine and they really look sharp. He hasn't had a game yet so we will see after he plays a whole game with them.
great value!
Very nice little boys shoe.  As any brand name shoe, a bit pricey for a small child but is taking the wear and tear of a very active young boy. He loves the spider man like appearance of this shoe.
I bought these for my son he said they reminded him of Spiderman we received the box but it was pretty true to size and they looked really really nice much better in person than in the picture he said they were comfortable and they lasted for a while but you know boys shoes don't want last that long but all in all we were very pleased with them and would buy again
The velcro stopped adhering after about a month. We had to buy our son a new pair of shoes. Stay away from this model.
Velcro doesn't last
Son LOVES these shoes, but after a month the web by looking detail was peeling off.
Good shoes.  They really hold up too!
It was a perfect fit purchase,  the kid love it.
My child is really rough on his shoes. Previously, I have bought Stride Rites and they lasted through all his runs, jumps, kicks, and bounces. They still had tread and a few worn out sides by the end of a shoe size, in one year. This time, I thought to try Skechers and let him pick these ones. They fit well and he loves them. After 2 weeks, the stitching on the Velcro strap broke. In 3 month, the treads were gone and now the bottom of the shoe is almost smoothed out. They may be good looking shoes but they do not last very long. I bought them in February and it's already May. I have to buy another pair of shoes. Do not plan to buy Skechers shoes again.
My grandson loves these shoes!  They look &#34;cool&#34; and are comfortable!
My son is a huge Spider-Man fan, so when we spotted these at a popular brick and mortar store, I knew we wouldn't be leaving without a pair. My son loved these at first and so did I. Very comfortable and a very attractive shoe with vibrant colors and the metal-like detailing around the heels is very cool. However, just like everyone else has stated, the Velcro has stopped working right at two months! I'm so mad! The poor kid was running around at recess with them flipping off his feet. I broke down and had no choice but to buy him some new LACE UP shoes. IT's been over thirty days of course, but I'm going back to the store in a few days to haggle with the sales people. Fifty bucks for two months is ridiculous!
My son loved these shoes!  The disappointment came from him only wearing them a month before the velcro would no longer hold and then started to fall off.  I just expected to get more than a month of wear of these shoes.
Grandson loves
Bought these at Christmas for a grandson and love the product for the price!
Really disappointed in this pair.  The Velcro is hard to keep tight, pops off with him just walking.  Had to purchase Hickies to keep them on;(
Good price, cute shoe and my 4 1/2 year old thinks they make him run super fast ! Drawback is as others said, velcro stops sticking after a couple of months. I am glad his feet grow fast and these won't last much longer.
My 8-year old loves the shoes and how comfortable they are but after a month the velcro strap ripped off so that's the end of this pair.
These worked well for our 5 year old for a while, but the velcro fell off rather quickly.
Exactly as pictured. Fast shipping!
Good
Prompt delivery. Item as expected.
Light weight and fits perfectly
comfortable and very beautiful. well
Don't know if it's the shoes themselves, or the size chart, but the size 3 was way too big even though my son's foot measured that way exactly in inches.  Just ordered a size 2.5, hope that'll be better.  Otherwise good sneakers and my son likes them.  Advice: get your child professionally sized before ordering.
Nice looking shoes, my son loves them. They are a little heavier than I expected (I was looking for very lightweight shoes).
My twins have been wearing these shoes a couple weeks now. They seem to be holding up very well. Very happy with the shoes. And delivery was on time and very fast.
good quality products
My son love it .He feel it very cool.
My son loves them!!!
Excellent
My son loves these shoes!
He loves them and they are holding up well.
Excellent
I bought these shoes last autumn. Must admit they are perfect for my son , who wears them everywhere, while playing soccerand  running whole day. really easy to clean, and they are still &#34;alive&#34; after months of usage. Definitely reccomend.
My son is 4yr and he loves this shoes. He always complaint of foot pain after standing long hours on his feet playing. since i got these sneaker he has not complaint once.that a plus in my book...
Excellent product, reliable seller, highly recommended and delivers the product at the date indicated
Looks a little bulky on my son's foot, but he likes it and says it's comfortable.
These things are so heavy.  I bought them for my son for school and they are clunky and heavy.  They are now play shoes because he shouldn't have to wear them all day.  Now I know why they were less expensive than most other Skechers.
I was reluctant to purchase these shoes because of the air pockets. I decided that if the product made it to the shelf it should hold up ok. It took my child 1 day with these shoes to where off the tread on one of the heal air pockets. The cause of the air pocket failure was going down the slide at the park which created friction and basically rubbed off the air pocket. My child went down the slide only a few times. No more Sketchers for us. This is our second fail from this company. The Nike shoes my other child had on did not even a rub mark from the slide.
got this for a kid so all these questions dont make any sense
good
I bought these for my 4 year old's birthday.  He loves them.  They remind him of Spiderman and he walked around all day showing everyone his new shoes. Very sturdy and the thick laces stay tied without a problem and the price could not be beat.
Really cute! My granddaughter loved them!
We've had these shoes for quite some time now. Great price and are still in great shape.
Sturdy, easy for my daughter to put on herself, and a cute tie dye print.  Can't beat the price either!
Fit was good but had to cut off the heel strap because it hurt my grand daughters heel, but she was fine with out it.
My daughter likes them so much, she wants to wear them everyday. Cannot find these in any stores nearby either.
Exelente
Awesome shoes. My daughter loves them.
Very good quality for the price.
Outstanding!  The ship time was great, and the lights are BRIGHT!!!!!  My little one loves them!
My daughter loves these shoes. She used to have the same shoes before and we got a new pair. They do last a long time, which is great.
Super cute!!
My daughter absolutely loves these shoes and so do I!!! Not only are they adorable but the fit was as I expected (toddler 7)! I also like the fact that they have the memory foam soles that way her feet stay nice and comfy when she is wearing them! Will be purchasing more when she outgrows these!
They are very durable and are a little narrow which was great for my daughter's foot.
My daughter LOVES these and so do I!<br />I swiped these at a huge bargain price of just $12 during an amazon sale!  They are so pretty and girly but not over the top and match with just about EVERYTHING she wears!  These are hers and my favorite shoes!
Very nice!!!!!!!!!!!
My daughter loves her new shoes so much she had to show her aunt the minute she got them. And BOBS will donate a pair of shoes to the less fortunate I think for every purchase made. That's great. Pretty and with a heart, love it.
Very cute!  run a little big
Super cute
Adorable! And durable! She wore these until they could no longer fit but they looked great the entire time!
So cute!  My daughter loves them because they sparkle do it's never difficult to get her to put them on.
These are way too big! My daughter loves them and says she will wear them when her feet grow.
Bought them for my son he loves them says it's like little pillows for his feet
great
Great
Perfect school shoes!  My daughter can easily get them on and off and they fit the Catholic School all-white shoe uniform code!
Great shoes comfortable
We got these for my Kindergartener to wear on PE days. They are perfect for what we needed. They are approved to wear with her school uniform. Our older girls are jealous. She has a different pair of sketchers, so we based the size on those. They fit great and she can put them on by herself.
They are wonderful. Great for my daughter's cheering
My daughter loves these shoes and raves about how comfortable they are.  They are easy to put on and stylish.
These shoes are stylish and durable.However, they run about a 1/2 size too small.I returned them for a 1/2 size bigger, but was credited 39 bucks even though the shoes were 41.00 bucks and I had to pay 7.00 bucks to ship them back as well.I would have appreciated my full 41.00 bucks as I returned their product back prompt.
These shoes are made very cheaply. The rubber on the soles was all bubbling up and warped out when we got them. The fabric is already separating from the rubber after a month of her wearing them.
I love Sketchers quality. Soles wear slow and well, lights never breaks, my kids never tire of them, and great support. Colors on Sketchers are often nicer than other brands (deeper hues and more natural tones). The color choice on many kids shoes give a good headache looking at them.
Love these and so so cute.
Great shoes for kids! Comfortable and nice fit-
My kid loves her's
My granddaughter just loves them. Wears them everyday.
My picky little girl LOVES them!
fine
My daughter loves these sneakers.  She wears them all day in summer camp.  They are lightweight and she says they're comfortable.  She's happy-I'm happy :)
Had to return them.  The length was good, but I forgot children's size is wider for an adult foot.  I didn't see this same color in women's sizes.
My daughter LOVES these shoes and she's rather picky about what goes on her feet due to some sensitivity issues.  We will definitely be getting another pair for fall.
looking good choice for comfortable
Cute, cozy and fit as expected. 6 year old loves them.
praise
Awesome shoes!!  My Daughter loves them!
Cute shoes!
Nice soft fit n tie due color. Cool for hippies n summer of love
My daughter wore the rubber sole out within 4 weeks, these are not shoes for active kids.
Awesome. Daughter loves them
my 5 year old daughter loves her shoes! I buy one in the next size up so she can keep wearing them as she grows!
My kid Skechers fit my granddaughter age 7 perfectly. She was so happy with them and so was grandma
Love these shoes!!!
I bought these because I could not find them in my size in women's shoes. I wear a size 5.
Absolutely love them !!
These fit a little differently as a child's size (as to be expected), but they are cute and I get lots of compliments on them. They don't have great arch support, but I knew that going in.
These shoes are so great, they are comfortable for my daughter and look adorable.  I gave 4 stars because the colors of the shoe are brighter online and more pastel in person.  So they do not match up quite as well with some of her new outfits as I expected.  But i am keeping them.
My daughter loves these. Extremely comfortable and very cute!
These shoes are very light weight and so comfortable my daughter loves them.
These are great shoes. My six year old loves them and tries to wear them daily.
It's very comfortable
Both pairs of shoes were for my grandkids at Easter. They fit well were comfortable for the kidsThey were easy for kids to put on and take off. Very cute on them as well.
We are Go Walk fanatics.  These are cute and comfortable.  A+!
I bought these shoes for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves them.  I had bought a pair months earlier and she loved them.  I also have 4 pairs of Skechers in this same design and have taken them on trips to Europe and they were perfect for the walking on all surfaces.
These are the perfect comfy shoes for little girls! my daughter wore them on a cruise and walked all over and never complained!<br />I love that they match everything! :) BONUS ___ insert mom happy dance here!
Beautiful and comfortable, my mum is happy with them.
My girl loves these shoes very comfy..I ordered me a pair of size 51/2 n kids  they nevergot to me n I paid for them need to know how I solve this problem thank you
I bought these for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she loves them. She has wanted to wear them every day. They are bright and colorful, good quality, light in weight and very comfortable.
skechers go walks are  great for my daughter with sensitive feet. protects feet from mulch at the playground yet nice and lightweight for hot days.
Daughter really likes them and cannot wait for school to start so she can wear them. They are a little darker than the picture but that;s ok. Be warned the flashing lights are super bright!  There is a nice memory foam insole to these which I did not see in the description. First pair of skechers and we are happy with them
My daughter loves these shoes.
Super cute shoes.  My daughter loved them.  Sad that she's already grown out of them but that's how it goes!  She got a good 7 months out of them and they are still in pretty good shape (she wore them A LOT).  I love Skechers Twinkle Toes.  Such cute shoes for kids.
Super cute shoes. My daughter loves them. One of doesn't light up but she doesn't mind.
Cute shoes. I bought them for my niece but lights dont work on the right shoe... She became very disappointed..
My granddaughter loves them. We bought a size larger so she can grow into them. I find that skechers run small anyway.
hello , lights not working
My daughter loves it. So far no complain of discomfort so I assumed they are good fit.
My 3 year old niece loves light up shoes. ...and so I keep buying.  These are fun and I had no issues with the lights.
These are great! My daughter loves them and they are holding up well.
These shoes are for a toddler. Adorable!
My daughter very love it. it is very beautiful.
Great shoes ðŸ˜€
I bought these shoes for my toddler, and she absolutely LOVES them! They're her absolute favorite pair of shoes to wear, and they're very easy to put on as she does so all by herself, and she is a month shy of turning two years old.  The little lights light up as she walks and she loves it.  They're easy to clean as well, and seem to be very comfortable for her.  I will be buying from the Twinkle Toes line again!
Love the shoes
Hands down my daughter favorite pair of shoes.
goood quality
Adoreable
I love these, and as my daughter is not quite a 5 yet, because of the elastic and velcro they fit her well. They are very cute and light up well.
My 2 year old granddaughter loves owls and sparkling shoes and these were perfect!
My daughter loved them and I loved the cheaper than usual price
Bought these shoes for my daughter. Really love the quality and how adorable they are on her. They fit pretty true to size, and she loves them.
Gdsughtet loves them.
Skechers are always good and always run true to size. Love them.
My 18 month old daughter absolutely loves these shoes. Carries them around the house on her hands clapping them together when she isn't wearing them. Loves seeing the lights flash.
I bought my daughter the owl ones last year for her birthday and she LOVES them. They are SO cute and she said they're really comfortable. She wears them everywhere with any outfit. I highly recommend.
Great sneaker,  Skechers are my go to sneaker for my 3 year old.  The colors and choices are always perfect.  Always a great fit.
Lights do not work on left shoe, ordered a replacement and it had the same problem.
I had no idea these were the cool kid shoes when I bought them. I'm grandma... How would I know?
So cute! I love these shoes. My daughter gets so many compliments on them. They have enough girly colors on them that they go with almost every outfit. Would buy again for sure!
Really adorable but runs somewhat large. Need some breaking in as well, fit a little stiff.
Today we received our third pair of monkey shoes from Amazon. These, like the two pair before them, do not do what they're supposed to do... Twinkle! Unlike the other two pair that we already tried, one of these actually works. The other, however, you could run over with a Mack truck and it still would not twinkle. I think I'm just about over it. My daughter will outgrow these before I receive a pair that work properly. Either that, or by the time she receives a pair that work, she will have stopped liking monkeys.
Perfect :)
I bought these shoes for my 2,5 year old daughter. She loves them! They fit well and she runs around and around without complaint.
cute but not washable
Very cute shoes. Fit is spot on. They light up very bright... So if you are driving at night and the little one starts kicking the seat, look in your rear view mirror and you might think you are getting pulled over.
These shoes are adorable! My daughter is in love with foxes and I was so thrilled to find these. The colors are beautiful. Very glittery and lots of sparkle. They light up is in a slightly different pattern then the previous twinkle toes. I almost think the lights are slightly bigger and brighter which looks great. They are going to make a wonderful birthday surprise. Overall I love them and I know my daughter will too. Excellent purchase.
Adorable shoes for my little girl and this was a really good price for them too.  Some of the other Twinkle Toe shoes were more expensive and it is hard to pay a lot for shoes they will soon grow out of but these were definitely worth it!
Bought these for my 2 year old daughter. They fit great and she loves the design and the lights.
My grandson Sam loved them. He couldn't wait to try them on and show them to his cousins!
Good
I bought these for my son. He loves sneakers that light up and also loves everything that is a game. These are too cute he loves them .  They were also like $25 cheaper than in the stores,  Highly recommend!
Shoes for my grandson.....
Quality shoe...Fit was perfect...Cool game!!!
I bought these for my grandson.  He loves them,  especially that he can play games on them!
Love thcm
My son love them! Great idea! Great game!
Cute shoe, but my 3 year old doesn't quite get the game aspect of it yet.
Bought these for my six year old and he absolutely loves them.
We are returning them!
So cute!
My grandson LOVED those light up / game time sketchers sneakers.
My son absolutely Loves his new shoes!  Thank You for a great product and fastest shipping!!
My son loves them and they are durable shoes.
Made the grandson happy, that's all that matters,  it's what we were looking for, and a fair price. Delivery was before date promised.
Well made shoe. Be aware only one shoe plays music and the so called games are simply pressing buttons for light and sound. Still, very cool idea
Son loves them!  So I am happy with them! â™¡
My son really likes them!
My son loooove it<br />It came on time and it was the same at the picture
My grandson wanted to wear them to bed!<br />He loved them.
Very cool shoes. My son love it.
Loved it
My nephew loved this shoes and would play with them when we were out in the street. you have to buy them 1/2 size bigger so they can fit okay
Great
Kids love them
Really expensive shoe for a 7 year old boy and a few weeks in got wet (they are SHOES after all should be made for all weather)  game no longer works.  Very disapointed!!
My 6 year old son love his new shoes!!
Grandson loves them!
My son loves these shoes.
Could not be happier ! Grandkids loved them ! They fit true to size & the Simon game is lots of fun ! Well made !
fun shoes
My boys loved the shoes but the electronics only last about a month - not sure if its overuse or if its just not built to withstand an active boy.  He was very sad when it stopped working but at this price I am not going to replace an otherwise good shoe.  The shoe with the electronics does seem relatively heavy to me but my son never mentioned it.
Grandson was over the moon with the shoe...  Seemed like a good fit.  Only problem, he wore them to shoe and they<br />were a distraction. :)
My son loves them but hate the fact that he can't win the game. Couldn't be happier
The novelty of these shoes is what drew us to buy them. They were a gift for my son. He loved them for a bit, but they really are not good performance shoes. They are great for hanging out, but not for sports or all day wear at school. His feet get hot and they are a bit bulky.
My son love it... He loves the lights and sounds awesome!!!
One of the lights stopped working after less than 3 months. Game is useless now. Would not buy again. Return policy valid for only 1 month so stuck with it.
My boy loved these shoes. Could not wait to play with them. Fit the same and about the same weight as any other sketchers shoes for boys.
VERY disappointed in these shoes. We received them 3 weeks ago and after my son was caught in the rain yesterday, the entire game stopped working. No lights, no sounds, nothing. I can't find anywhere to contact Amazon or the seller so we are stuck with expensive, non-working shoes. My 6 year old waited 6 months to get them so needless to say he is very upset as well.
Fits well and is so much fun
My grandson loved these. Fit true to size. All his tennis shoes are sketchers so I knew what size to order
My son loves these shoes. Thankfully they don't distract him in class. They are his favorite shoes now.
My son loves them, just really expensive~
I bought this shose for my 5 yrs, well almost 6 yrs old son, for his 6th birthday.<br />My son loves it and is happy to show off this shose to his friends.<br />I was concerned if the sounds of the game would be too loud but it was OK, not too annoying sounds<br />It pricy but I'm glad to see my son's big smile every time we go out with this shose..
Ordered size 13 for my 6-year old son, and so far, he really likes them.  He says they are comfortable, and of course, he loves the game.  He hasn't had them long enough for us to tell how durable they are, but they seem to be well-made.  So far, so good. . .
Not worth the money....could have bought Jordans. My son says they hurt his feet when he runs. He only wore them twice. I'll never order shoes or clothes from amazon because they're return policy isn't good. Sad face
My son loves his game kicks
Awesome
I bought them for my Grandson he really likes them..yes I would recommend to anyone
my grandson loves the shoes
There are visible glue blobs between the soles and the shoe itself. Poorly made but I'm not gonna bother sending them back. Let's just say NOT WORTHLESS THE MONEY AT ALL
Perfect ...arrived early and my son loves them!
My grandson loves them. They look very well made. They were true to size. Thought they were expensive for children's sneakers but it was a birthday gift so I spent the extra.
Grandson likes these Sketchers. He thinks they make him run faster!
The color was very depressing to my 4 year old grandson, he doesn't like them because they look more like boots, he won't wear them, only plays the game on them! Should have come in blue!
Great tennis shoes and my son loves it!<br />Just don't send your kids to school wearing it. It's a major distraction!
Excellent servicd
These were purchased for 6 year old grandson, he loves them and apparently the rest of his kindergarten class is equally enamored
Grandson saw these on TV and begged for them for his 5th birthday. A bit pricy, but a solid shoe. He plays the game ( same a Simon) in the car. School started out as an issue but quickly resolved with &#34;or else.&#34; He loves them. Would recommend to others.
Son loves them!
my 4yr old grandson loves these shoes
My son loves these shoes!!!
one of the lights broke within a few weeks. I expected as sketchers they would be cheaply made and as kids, the novelty would wear off quickly but for $50 I was hoping they would work at least as long as the shoes lasted (high hopes were for 8-12 months). alas, sketchers dissapoints again.
Son loves them.
The shoes are strong and durable. They match with everythingbaincevthey have a variety of colors in them. There's only 1 game, and it can be turned on & off. My son loves them.
My son loves them and that's all that matters! Thanks!
My son loves them
Compared to another design of sketchers shoes we bought, these ran big in the same size as we got the other stretchers shoes, not much more but enough to notice.
He loves them
my grandson loves these shoes!!!!!!
I bought this for my 5yr old boy. He loves it. He shows it off to everyone and the memory game keeps him busy.
These skerchers gamekicks t shoes are. a very clever idea where you play. games with music<br />They are black with colored patches.that play<br />music thanks for great price and delivery
My grandson loves these shoes.  They were just what he wanted!!
We love these shoes. If you have a child under 10 these are a must, boys especially. My 6 yr old is obsessed. I recommend turning the sound off immediately though.
they are a kids sneaker and my kid loves them hasn't complained about any issues he wears them all day at school and has fun with the game on the side.
My son loves these shoes!  Not only are they the &#34;coolest&#34; they are very comfortable. He can't wait to show them off to his friends at school.
They were a gift.  Fit well.  Child absolutely loves these shoes.
Very nice my son like it
Pretty good looking shoes. My kid likes them. The compasses do not work. Do not know if this is the norm or they are lemon shoes. Most likely the compass feature is only a novelty.
The shoes are dinamic and fun; perfect in size and comfortable! Perfect for adventurous kids and comes with a magnifying glass for any type of investigation, with fun lights and a compass! They are perfect.
My grandson loved these shoes! He was very excited to get them and wear them for the first day of school!!
Great shoe! It lights up when you press buttons, not with every step.
cant get my son to take off
My first thoughts was that the shoes were great.  My 6yrs old son loved them.  Soon afterwards I noticed both compasses didn't work.  They point in random directions.  About a month later the lights stop working and now 3 months of normal uses, the shoes are falling apart.  The Skechers S is pealing off and the strap with the buttons have slip in two exposing the buttons in between.  I've purchased other Skechers shoes for my son and he usually outgrows them before they wearout.  I do not recommend you purchase these shoe.
My son loves them and they were right on time
Got ours in the mail, took them out of the box excited to show our son after he woke up only to find the compass was broken on both shoes (it is stuck pointing north in any direction) and the lights only have one color instead of changing to three different. When you press the color change light, it just turns them off. Was going to give them to him anyways because he thinks they are cool but for $50 you would think the shoes would work as advertised. We opted to return them. This isn't our first sketchy pair of sketchers. Needless to say, it will be our last pair though.
Love these shoes.  They fit true to size and are made very well. I also love that the lights on a on off switch. The compass on the tongue is also neat anfd fun for my son. I almost didn't buy because of the price but I am happy that I gave in to his begging.  He is very excited to wear on his first day of first grade.
Cute! My boys love them!
Grandson loved these!! Had no idea they had compass and flashlight! Adorable for 4 year old
Accurate delivery and package intact :)
I thought  this  shoe was kind  of  plain  but my son loves them. He thinks  the  compass  is really  cool and  loves the  fact that the  flashlight  in the  tip of  the  shoe changes colors. Very sturdy shoe design  as well .
Purchased for 6y.o. He loved them. Ordered exact size and the fitted with little room to spare. Flashlight works perfectly. Live black glossy look. Definitely recommend this product
My son loves these! He was so excited to show them off. The lights and compass is so neat.
They are made small I brought a 1/2 size bigger and they still was too small
I buy sketchers always for my son. Though he does have wide feet we generally go up one size. If I have any complaint it would be that everywhere sold out of the red pair of these. Not that big of a deal my son loves them
Lights did not function properly from the start.
Only part was the word sketchers was coming off the second day. Otherwise my boy loves sketchers
I didn't realize the toe was shiny, I ain't talking about the lights either. I hate that. Everything else is good.
These shoes were a hit! Our son loves them and would wear them every day, all day long. He loves the compass and changing lights, and I have found him in dark rooms/areas with the built-in flashlight on more than one occasion!<br />The compass does get stuck sometimes, so it's not always correct and most of the time only 1 shoe shows the correct direction.<br />The buttons for the lights are very sensitive. Whenever the shoe gets tightened, the lights turn on. It can get annoying, but so far so good.
Our grandson asked for these for his 7th birthday. He loves them and when he wore them to school the day after his birthday, he came home and said he was the coolest kid in first grade!!!
Our son loves them.
Again, perfect for my son. He love them
Falling apart after 1 month of use.  The velcro strap that contains the lights wiring has broken apart.  Other than that the shoes are great and my son loves them
My son Loves his new sneakers!  He has gotten a ton of compliments on them.  We couldn't be happier.
My son loves them. They are appropriately sized and seem to be of good quality.
my 6yr old loves them!
All original packing including magnifying glass came with these shoes.  Very fun and a hit with the kids at school.
They are ok, the pic looked like they were shiny only on the toe but it's actually the whole shoe. I think the stride rites are neater we have owned several of those or even the hot lights. If I would have seen them in person I prob wouldn't have paid more than $25, I expected more out of them, the color changing isn't that great it appears to cycle white, red, blue green.. Meh.
Look great, fits as expected
Bought for my 5 year old. Both shoes had light problems after just 3 days of normal wear. No water or abuse. Bought them Saturday afternoon, wore them home, wore them to a show on Sunday, then school Monday.  They are supposed to have little lights in the toes that you can turn on and off and cycle colors red, green, blue, and white.<br /><br />One shoe is stuck on blue and won't turn off.<br /><br />The other only goes between red and white and off now.<br /><br />Will contact the store about a refund or exchange, but unfortunately Monday was trash day so the box and receipt are gone - they fit, and looked great. Never expected to need to consider a shoe warranty. I didn't think they would last forever, but 3 days for BOTH shoes is just garbage for $50.
These shoes are a big hit, both with my son and everyone who sees them.  Built in compasses and headlights?  Yes!
A+
Bought these for my son, who has a wide foot, and was crossing my fingers that they would fit. They do fit perfectly, and they look great. Happy with this purchase.
Very nice. My niece brags about it
My son love this for school, just had issue with colour of the lace should be dark brown instead of grey.
I'm extremely happy that I was able to find the shoes my son needs for his school. They fit him great, they r very comfortable plus inside they have an extra cushion for comfort
as expected
I ordered these for my son's school uniform. After reading the mixed reviews on size, I ordered the same size he wears in Nike's. Perfect fit. They have memory foam insoles for all day comfort.
Nice and very comfortable! My child loved them!
skechers ALWAYS win!
Love it
Good
Fits good...kid loved it....inner linings wear faster..need good finishing inside...
After reading other reviews I ordered a half size up and they fit my 5 year old perfect!! He says they are comfortable and he doesn't complain when he has to wear them to chapel day at school or to church, which is worth 5 stars to me!! They are a little snug when putting them on and the laces are too short to do a proper &#34;double knot.&#34; But once on they fit very well. Hug the foot, but not too tight. Gives good support and the memory foam is an added comfort! My son and I like that they look like sneakers, but are still dressy. Time will tell as to how they hold up. Little boys are tough on any shoe!
My son didn't complain about them and wores them to gym. So they must be pretty comfortable.
nice
Shipment was received sooner than expected and in good condition from Skec hers Kids Footwear. I bought the shoe a size bigger since my son is close to out growing his current size.
Incredible price, and great sizing.  I got a size up from my sons regular shoe size just to get some more mileage out of them.
These were way to small definitely need to order 1.5 sizes bigger. I had to return them bc they were too small and the price was double for the next size up still in toddlers so we did not order again. Other than that they were perfect and light weight. I love that they are machine washable.
My son has wide feet and I've been having a hard time finding shoes that fit. A friend told me to try Skechers because although they don't advertise as a WIDE shoe, they would fit well. They are perfect! They fit him comfortably and he can wear them all day long without any issues. The best part is that these are machine washable so I can just toss them in the washer when they get dirty.
Excellent product
Great buy, love the foam insert.
super light and easy to put on. My son loves it.
Cute shoes, but they run small.  They didnt fit, had to return them. I would recommend buying one size up from what your child takes normally.
My daughter loves her shoes. They are colorful, the lights work and she looks cool wearing them to school. Sizing is as expected for Skechers. We're happy with our purchase
This is the second pair I have bought for my 6 year old.  I only had to get a second pair because we like them so much!  They lasted a whole summer of camp and are not falling apart a bit.  They also still look good after several months of everyday wear.  I wish Skechers would make more athletic slip on styles! Update: Third pair! My now 7 year old still loves them and was sooo excited for a new pair!
Comfortable for my son!
My son loves these shoes!
Excellent!
they were for my son but he says that this shoes are very comfortable he is 11 years old
My son LOVES the memory foam, he says they are the most comfortable shoes he's ever had. It's nice that they are simple black. I find it difficult to find sneakers that don't look obnoxious.
My son says they feel like walking on pillows.
These are the most comfortable shoes!  I originally bought them for my son but I have worn them more than he has.
Kid loves the shoes, very comfortable.  Shoe laces frayed immediately though.
High quality.Beautiful
My son has been wearing these a lot since buying, and he's very happy with them. The arch support could be better in my opinion, but it doesn't seem to bother him.
My nine-year-old grandson, who wears a size 6, LOVES these memory foam shoes.  He says they are the most comfortable sneakers he has ever had because of the memory foam.
I am so pleased with Skechers as always. I purchase this shoes for my 11 yr old boy and he loves them. They are extremely comfortable and great looking. Excellent quality!
my grandson loves them
Really bummed about these shoes.  I had bought my son a pair of these from the sketchers store and he loved them.  They fit well and looked to hold up to hours of play so I was stoked to see these blue pair on amazon.  The black paint on the rim of the shoe came off after the first day he wore them to daycare.  I don't know if this pair was made by a different manufacturer but after a month of use they look like they are year old shoes.  I guess I need to go directly to the sketcher store to make sure I'm getting a good shoe.
My 7-year-old son thought these shoes were cool looking and comfortable, too!
He loved the fact that he has two different colored shoe laces.
My son loves them
When my son first put these on and walked around, he told me he never wanted to take these shoes off. The memory foam insoles, soft, yet durable outer fabric, and incredibly bendable bottom soles make these super comfortable and flexible to wear. I REALLY want my own pair now! Just a warning - they are great for everyday wear, but not meant for athletic use, so don't let your kids use these for gym class or running or other things that are strenuous on the feet. We bought the grey/orange and the navy/yellow ones and they both look very nice and stylish without being too flashy. They also all come with two sets of laces that are the main color of the shoe and the contrast/accent color so they can be switched to your/your child's liking. HIGHLY recommend!
Quality is very good, I am very satisfied.
This is our 2nd pair of this same shoe, just a different color. These shoes look great and are very light-weight? My 6-year-old loves them!
Fit well. But didn't hold up. Material seems cheap and the color around the base started to wear off after the first time he wore them. Wouldn't buy them again. Not worth the money.
has shown wear rather quickly, we'll see how long they hold up.
Our son absolutely LOVES these shoes.  He refers to them as &#34;couch cushions&#34; - meaning that they are as comfortable as laying around on the couch.
good sneaker. little big
My son loves the memory foam - he walked all day on vacation without complaining about his feet!  Very comfortable for him and seem to be durable as well.
These shoes are proving to be very rugged. Over 1 month and my 6 year old hasn't destroyed them yet. They are actually holding up quite well and my son loves the shoes. I would definitely buy them again and I'd actually buy them for my older son if he wasn't so fashion conscious.
My 7yo loves them. I have to make him take them off around the house or he'd forget. Skechers have always done well for us...
my son put them on and been all smiles
My grandchild love it.
This is my son's favorite pair.They are so light, sturdy, and comfortable that my son feels invisible wearing them. He is a ten year old aspiring stuntman. Aparently, these shoes are also what the kids are wearing in school.
excellent, my son love it!!
My 8 yr old son loves these and thinks they're cool; very comfortable too.  I like the variety of colors available and affordable price.
Great shoes for my 9 year old
love them!
My son likes to slip his foot in his shoes and the back on these sneakers are very soft. They are crushed in a bit after only 3 days of wear. Also, the black trim above the white sole is peeling off already!
I love the fit just doesn't hold up well. Soles already showing lots a wear.
Excellent for comfort.  Great pair of walking sneakers.  Very good quality and price.
My kid loves loves loves these shoes, he said they are so comfortable!
Got it for my 6 years old nephew and he really liked it. It fits perfectly and feels comfortable.
Nice product
My son loves them and said they are very comfortable. They definitely run small. I always order a 1/2 size up to allow for growth, and they fit perfectly. No room for growth though. Great shoe for a decent price. They come with gray or orange laces.
I couldn't find a suitable sneaker for my son at our local store so I just ordered up a size in what is the most similar shoe to his last Skechers, here on Amazon.  They are a win.  He loves them.
All Good
My son wears these shoes every day for school and to play outside.  This is his 2nd pair because he loves them so much.  He says the memory foam is really comfortable and should be in all athletic shoes.
My boy likes the memory foam and the neon color.. Win win.. :)
My son likes it very much! It is beautiful! We decide to buy what we like again!
My son loves these shoes. In particular, he likes the &#34;gel&#34; technology, which they've been marketing a lot in tv commercials.
Great purchase
Awesome shoes. My 5 year old son loves them and the memory foam is very comfortable.  They are his second pair.
These are for my son and he won't take them off! Loves the feel.
good
very confortable
The shoes scuff really easy, but are comfortable .
My son loves these shoes. They fit great and he says they are very comfortable. Skechers have always been a favorite!
I bought them as a present and they were instant success. The only kind of negative aspect of this kind of sneakers is that they do not provide good arch support and the heels are rather flat. But they are super cute and confortable to wear for a day at school. ;)
Too big, tight in the toe so they need to be a little big but the added weight and having to upsize just to get shoes that light up- seems like sketchers has taken a few steps backwards since this past decade.
ORIGINAL POST: They've changed the straps on these (which is a good thing) They're cute and comfortable. She gets lots of compliments!  UPDATE 10-29-2015 These shoes have already fallen apart!!  They've only been worn about 3 days a week. Very disappointing!! Our second pair of Sketchers to fall apart - will not buy this brand again!
Awesome shoes for kindergarden! Daughter loves them
The shoes are great and a great price
Very trendy! My daughter loved it.
bought for my 3 year old and she absolutley loves them. They do seem just a tad narrower than her pair that only has two straps rather than three.
Item came it great conditions and earlier then exspected. My daughter absolutely loves these shoes. All the lights worked.
I ordered this for my daughter who turns 6 years next month. It fits her perfectly and it came with tattoos too. She loves it and I am very happy with the price I paid Amazon. We are very impressive with this purchase!!!
They were exactly what my Granddaughter wanted for pre-k
These shoes are great and size was right on
My granddaughter for whom I bought the Twinkle Toes shoes loved them , however they were too big.
Fun and colorful
Excellent
Grandaughter loved them !!!! They are really cute. I just hope they last ;)
My daughter loves them. I bought them for school, but as soon as they arrived she had to have them.
Cute!  But... The glitter on the Velcro straps is already wearing off.  Too expensive for this to be happening already
Beautiful snickers
We need to grow in to these because like all sketchers they seem to be huge for their size, but nevertheless my daughter loves them. Must be those flowers.
Awesome shoes and fun for kids! Bought many of them!
Fit perfectly my 6 year old daughter love these types of sketches sneakers
My four year old loves these shoes
I LOVE Skechers twinkle toes! These are honesty the cutest shoes and we've gotten the most wear out of this brand. I bought these shoes for my five year old and received a different pair of twinkle toes for my just turned two year old for her birthday, both are equally adorable and excellent quality!
Good product and seller.
I have no information on how these fit or how long they were worn. What I do know is that my niece love love loved them when she opened the gift.
My 7 year old is so happy with these shoes. She thinks they are fun and stylish!!
Five stars
excellent highly recommended
My daughter loves it!
Bought for my 5 year old Granddaughter who asked specifically for these due to the Memory Foam inserts.  Saw the commercial on TV.  She loves them and they are very cute.  Fit as expected.
Cute sneakers, my daughter loves them. After wearing them for the second time the rubber on the sides started peeling out and many rhinestones fell off. I'm so disappointed, those are expensive shoes. A friend of mine had the same problem (after wearing them 3times) and contacted the seller but wasn't helpful.
very good shoes. my daughter likes it so muchã€‚
Kind of disappointed...my daughter has worn these approximately 5 days and the soul is starting to come away from the shoe on the interior side of her foot already.  For $40 I would have expected them to last a bit longer than 5 days.  I know children are rough on shoes, but this is ridiculous!
I bought a size 3.5 US Big Kid and it was way too big on her!  I also bought a size 3.5 US Big Kid Asics Gel-Storm GS running shoes and that fit her perfectly with a little room to spare.  She'll just have to wait until her feet grows bigger to wear these.  Other than the size, the lights are cool!
I ordered these for my 5 year-old granddaughter and she loves them!  Very cute shoe for a little girl!
This pair of shoes is my favorite purchase on Amazon ever.  I would only buy them for a child 4 or over as they spin on the ball of the foot.  They are perfect for a little girl who love to dance and twirl.  They are comfortable, sturdy, adorable, and full of sparkle.  I love them and they are the prettiest tennis shoe I have come across.
I bought these pair of Gamekicks for my daughter.  I bought her first pair of Gamekicks earlier this year at the Stride Rite store she she loved them.  But the battery eventually wore out and the the soles wore down from use during the school year.  When I saw these on Amazon for the price, I couldn't believe the great price so I bought her another pair to replace the previous ones.  Unfortunately, right when we received the package, the game sounds were weaning.  Now, one week later (we received the package 8/23) and today is 8/30, it sounds like the batteries are almost out of juice and my daughter won't be able to play with her game shoes anymore.  These shoes don't allow you to replace the batteries.  So I'm a little disappointed that I purchased these and in hindsight may have been better off going back to the retail store to buy the shoes.
Granddaughter loves them.
My daughter loves wearing them everywhere she goes.  We've had them over a week & have had no problems.
These shoes are not worth money. Very cheap looking and a bad idea to have children playing with dirty shoes!
I was very disappointed with the lights. I do like the looks of the sneaker and the fit.
My 7 year old loves it. the game was a little challenging.
I got these for my granddaughter and she loves them
My 5 year old loves these
Good value,  good quality.  Very cute idea
They were perfect for my granddaughter.  She loves them.
How can they sell a product that cannot be washed? The whole key of this shoe is the memory game. Well, after the first wash the light memory game stopped working. Manufacterer doesn t state anywhere or warn the costumer about this. I feel like they stole my money!
Unique, clever idea.
My daughter loved it!
My daughter absolutely loves these shoes! She has only had them for 1 day but I can tell shes going to take good care of them because they are her favorite shoes.
My 7 year old daughter loves these sneakers and this is the second pair I bought.  Same exact style. One big issue I have is the quality which seems to be lacking for the price you pay. She has had the first pair for less than 6 weeks and they are destroyed!  And I do mean destroyed. Only reason I'm buying a second pair is that my daughter still loved the style and since she only wore them for less than 2 months it's hard to convince her to get a different style.
Love them
My daughter loved these shoes.  She says they are comfortable and that they fit well.  She is in school and all the kids want her to play with the shoes during class but she does not...and thanks to the &#34;off&#34; button, other kids cannot simply make them make noise and get her in trouble.<br /><br />They are durable, HOWEVER, my daughter is extremely rough on them on a daily basis and she was only able to get about 6 weeks wear out of them.  She plays on playgrounds during summer school and is in the dirt, on her knees playing, etc., and so there is heavy abuse.  I'm actually surprised they lasted 6 weeks given what I know she does to other shoes.
I bought these for my daughter.  They fit great and she loves them!
These were for my 5-year-old granddaughter! She could wear them all the time and not know if they provided good arch support!
We bought these shows from the Sketcher store at the mall, so the game worked, and still works as I'm tossing them in our garbage can today, about 3 months after purchasing them. The Velcro strap fell apart and finally tore completely as my six year old was tightening her strap the other day, while we were a good 30 minute walk from our car, lovely day! She was so upset!! I like the concept of these shoes, but this is our second pair of sketchers in one school year that had the Velcro straps completely break. Not worth the hype. She was bored with the game the same week as purchase. I'd say splurge for fun if you've got the money, but if you don't, then invest it in a wiser pair of shoes than these. I think Sketchers with tie laces would be better. That's what we are trying next.
My daughter loves these shoes. She always wears Sketchers, so the shoe fit as it was supposed to.
Bought these for my daughter, she loves them.  I'm not sure about the comfort or arch support???  She hasn't complained and they fit well.
Got these shoes at the request of my 10-year-old granddaughter, for her birthday.  She absolutely flipped once she saw them, and was the center of attention in her classroom when she wore them to school the next day!  She loves them in every area - the look, fit, and of course- the game!
my daughter adore this shoes!
My granddaughter loves these and they fit her perfectly.  I'm glad I bought them for her!
Love them
My daughter loves them
My kid loves these shoes!
My daughter loves these shoes! Would definitely recommend!
The shoes are nice, much like the photo. If you like bright and sparkly then these will please. Lightweight and comfortable, they are quick and easy to put on. We probably would not have bought them if they didnt have the little memory game but my girl is glad we did.
My niece loves her skechers gamekicks and they are not loud so they would not distract or disrupt a classroom if she wore them to school.  They are definitely a good thing for her to wear when she is at a doctors office.  I only wish they made them in adult sizes.  Basically its a simon game intergrated into a shoe!!
The kid loved them.  Exactly what she wanted.
Daughter loves them she wear all the te
I purchased these shoes for my daughter and got the shippment on 5/7/15 in less than 2 week these piece of junk started making a loud sqeaking noise that was consistant and annoying . so I finally got fed up with the noise and decided to check the shoes . it turns out that it was the right side shoe that was making all the noise towards the back ( heel area ) on the bottom of the shoe . I tested the shoe by just pressing in that area and sure enouph got an annoying sqeak everytime on top of that these shoes made my little girls feet stink bad never has this happened to her befor she's only 7 yr old . I contacted skechers directly about this and got terrible customer service and was basically told well you can send them to use but you need to pay shipping and there is a 4 to 6 week turn around and a replacement is NOT guaranteed . this is clearly bad quality control as these shoes are made in some sweat shop in CHINA . I am returning to amazon and boycotting skechers going forward due to this very bad experience .
The kids loved definitely recommend them to other people
My daughter loves these shoes.  They seem true to size and she just loves wearing them and playing the games.
My daughter loved those shoes!!!
Great Shoes! They are safe, comfortable and fun, so the kids are happy to wear them!
daughter loves them!
purchased for 10 year olds birthday, when she put them on she did the ummm sound and said to me they feel just like they said they would on TV.  Referenced tor gel inner sole or the soft inner sole in the ad. I purchased on the recommendation of my great granddaughter I had never see the advertisement or the shoe before.  She was very happy with the product and  has worn them  to school every day since I gave them to her.
Bought these for my grandaughter...she loves them...very happy with them
Stopped working after one day. Sent them back.
My daughter loves them!
Kid loves shoes
My granddaughter loves her new tennis shoes.
My granddaughter absolutely loves them!!!!!
They were perfect in size and my grand daughter just loves them. A little expensive though for little kids shoes!
My little girl loves these shoes! the first pair that were sent the game on the side didn't work, but I sent them back and received the new pair in just a few days! they fit great! she wears them all day to school and has never complained about anything!! the &#34;simon&#34; game is fun for all ages!! worth the $$$!!
Daughter loves them.
The shoe is a good fit out of box but I'm surprised at how quickly they fell apart. My kids have other name brand sneakers that they've worn for longer and still look good. The silvery strap on these are already silver-less and they look like they have seen about a year of wear and tear in a matter of months.
Granddaughter loves these shoes. Very cute
Thanks!!
Excellent
My great granddaughter was the hit of her first grade class when she went back to school after &#34;spring break.&#34;  She loves them.
amazing and fun shoe for children and stylish :)
My daughter was very happy with these.
My granddaughter loves these shoes!!!! They are also very cute!!!
Cool shoe my daughter loves
My daughter finds these shoes very comfortable and likes the interactive game.
I love these shoes because they are a reasonable price, they have a flexible sole to develop growing feet, a minimal arch support which is perfect, and they are cute and stylish!  I do wish they were a bit wider and I think as my daughter's feet grow I might have to switch to Soft Stars completely.  Not sure why so many manufacturers want to try to squish feet into narrow shoes, but these will work for now!!
No complaints! Really cute and my 8 year old niece loves them.
Like walking on air.  I wear a ladies 5 but found that girls 3 fit better.  I also buy casual shoes in girls 3 from a local popular store.  These are a bit larger than a regular 3.  But not much.  I love these shoes I like the stretch material.  The gel soles with the memory foam is fantastic.
These were a birthday gift to my 7 year old granddaughter.  She had seen them advertised and wanted them. She loved them when she opened them on her birthday
These shoes or not only cute, but comfortable as well. Like walking on air.
Super cute!
good
My daughter loves them and they're a big hit at school!
Excellent thank you very much
These are great I love these!
The shoes are very cute, they fit right, and they were a very light weight. And a great price !!
I have loved the Go Run line due to my PF, but it never occurred to me to get my 7yo son a pair. He is the king of flip flops, but when we went to NYC, I made him wear these. He hated them at first (in southern Florida, it's sandals or nothing), but gave them a try. By lunch time, he loved them, and ran all over. I don't know if these have the same mid-sole strike as the adult versions, but he said they made him feel like he could fly. :) They are keepers!
My daughter loves her new shoes.  Thanks!!
Skechers are my tried and true brand for my daughter! She loves them and they really last! Excellent
bought for my daouhtï¼Œand she seemed like it
Beautiful shoes, comfortable to wear. My daughter likes it.
Greatï¼
They are cute. They fit as expected but i don't recommend them for kids with wide feet. They are a little narrow
Very light material. Not as hardy as I hoped, but cute and comfy nonetheless!
Great fit great price and my daughter loves these shoes!
Ordered these for my 5 year old and she absolutely loves them! They fit just as expected and came with both pink and purple shoe laces!
Excellent sneakers! My 7 year old daughter is rough on shoes and these have stood the test of time. They fit her perfectly. Her gym teacher even complimented her on them saying they are great sneakers for running in. They are priced very reasonably. I am very pleased I bought them.
Great play shoe.
good
This is the second pair I've bought for my daughter.  Her feet are a little bit wide, so the super stretchy fabric is wonderful.  She told me that they feel like pillows for her feet!  I will keep buying them as long as Sketchers keeps making them!!
I bought these for my daughter for back to school, and she loves them. &#34;I'm walking on pillows, Mom!&#34; She loves wearing them sockless, and I have a pair of Go Walk Sketchers that I've been known to throw in the wash when that becomes an issue. They are easy care shoes.
Great!
Great shoe! Lightweight, soft and comfy! We love them so much that everyone in the family owns a pair :)
Beautiful and comfortable
I bought this shoes for my kid girl, its perfect, very light, and great looking.
Soft Moc is a bad seller. Consider yourself warned. Runs tight across the top of the foot. Not one of Sketcher's Go walk best shoes.
She loves them
comfortable
I've had 2 pairs of these for myself. We were going to Disney for a week and my 6 year old complains of her &#34;legs getting tired&#34; from walking around wal mart. So I went searching for these and Amazon had the most options as far as color and kids sizes. The price seems high but they are them same price every where pretty much. Needless to say she walked around all week no complaints and has wore them through the rest of the summer. She loves the bright hot pink color, comfiness, and not having to wear socks. I have washed them and they turned out great. No complaints !
My daughter loves to wear it all day. It is light, soft.
We went on vacation to D.C. this summer so I decided to order my 7yr. Old a good pair of walking shoes. These fit her great and were so comfortable.
very good.
Nice shoes. The fit is great. They look stylish and comfortable. So far no complaints.
Too large
I tried on Skechers for myself and it felt like walking on a pillow.  I ended up buying me two pair from Amazon and decided if they were that comfortable for me, my little 4 year old mini me deserved the same comfort.  So, I bought these for our next vacation trip.
I am going to order a 2.5 as that will fit me the best, but I will keep these
My daughter really loves these.  They are light weight and they are easy to put on/take off.  Sketchers in general run a little large I think and these were no exception.  Glad I didn't size up any extra.
These shoes are intended to be a cross between a sock and a shoe. Unfortunately, they reeked after only a few wearings. It was so bad that we had to keep them outside.  My daughter would have to wash her feet upon taking them off in order to lessen the smell.  Also, they are fabric and we had a tear in them almost immediately.  I ended up throwing them away.
These were a little large, but I just bought some cheap insoles for now.  My daughter hates to wear socks, so these are the perfect compromise when she can't wear flip flops.  My daughter is very particular about her shoes, and she has no complaints about these.  This is her second pair!
Bought three pairs of these, the girls love them
Great fit and comfortable !
My kids really beat up these shoes, but they last all summer.  However because they don't wear socks with them they need to be washed often and only last the season.
Very comfortable!
Love the shoes!  Comfy, but a little large.
I bought this shoes for my daughter. They are a perfect fit and she absolutely loves how comfortable they are.
unfortunately the shoe is falling apart at the back.material is separating from the rubber treads i wanted to buy more because my granddaughter loves them. but i am not happy with the quality.
My daughter loved her shoes!! They are extremely comfortable and match well will a variety of clothes!
Excellent !! My kid loved!!!
Just what my grand daughter wanted!!
Very confortable !!!!
My grand daughter loves them.
Very comfortable.
My daughter loves these shoes and says they are super comfortable. However, we had to size down a size for them to fit.  She has worn them to school almost every day since she got them, including for PE.
Great shoes! My daughter loves them and this is her third pair
I am a 66 year old women who takes a size 3 shoes.  These shoes fit real good but because of my age I do need a little more arch, or more cush for my heel.  Anyway this product is great, delivered on time.
Very comfy. Pretty color. Going to be perfect for vaca
Comfy and good for walking and beaching
Ordered for sister who has to have two different sizes. That is hard to find, when one is a childs and one is an adults, not tomention the expense of two pair, but these worked great & will greatly assist in her discomfort. Shoes great but package/shipping very ad. Package was rippedonone side, both boxes crushed
Waiting for the Easter Bunny to deliver these shoes!<br />Already have one pair so I'm confident they will fit the same . . . hopeful actually!
Bought a pair for my daughter and myself. As she puts it, &#34;it is like walking on pillows.&#34; The uppers are different than the cloth gowalk 1. They are a bit thicker yet breathable soft material.
Bought for my older daughter who wears a size 13. These shoes were too small. I would suggest ordering a size up as they are not stretchy or easy to get child's foot into.
Comfy as usual, but I am not sold on the new shape and material. Kids preferred the &#34;old&#34; ones.<br />They were stretchier and easier to put on.
Ok this is 2nd pair.  First pair from local shoe store.  Then these.  Not the same shoe.  More plastic less cushion. I also ordered myself a pair same complaint.<br />Go to store do not order.
My daughter who just turned 8 loves these!!!
My daughter loved it.<br />So light and easy to put on.
Comfortable shoes
These shoes were a great purchase. The quality is great. The shoes seem like they will hold up well. Also the style of the shoes are awesome. They look even better in person. Would recommend this sneaker!!
Really cute shoe.  Granddaugher loved it.
Disney approved! miles and miles of walking and my daughter didn't complain ONE BIT!
Very comfortable and stylish!
My granddaughter loved her shoes! They fit perfectly and the colors were very vivid!
I can ALWAYS count on my Skechers to fit !!  Wore them 8 hours the first day...walking 6  of them !
Very comfortable shoe!
My daughter likes it.
like it very much.
I purchased these for myself because I have small feet and it is much cheaper to buy kids shoes. I have plantar fasciitis in both feet (mild now, but still present). I wore these to an amusement park all day today and the only time my feet hurt was when I was standing for too long in one place. They are so comfortable, by far the most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever worn. They were not too narrow as some kids shoes are (my kids Nike running shoes are wider than these). I would recommend these to anyone that deals with foot pain and wants to continue life as though they did not. I think I will pick up a pair of the Gowalk sandals too.
Very Good
It's very comfortable.
Bought these shoes for my 7 year old daughter.  She loves them!  Talks about how comfortable they are and wants to wear them everyday!
Fit as expected and comfy
These boots were everyday wear for my daughter. She hates socks so these were great. Lasted about 3 months
Cute
Good for all day and playing at school.  We walked around the zoo all day and toward the end the shoes started to hurt. For the zoo, it is socks and sneakers.  For around town, these shoes are very comfortable.
My daughter loves these shoes! She likes how they look and the great colors offered, but the love is with the memory foam insole. I cannot speak to how they hold up yet.
This is my daughter's second one.  Love it!
I have very small feet. I wear woman size 4 so since they don't offer my size in women I opted for the kids version and I'm glad I did. They are cheaper and look almost the same. I would get 2 in kids sizes but I got 1.5 in this shoe. I was gonna order these online then opted to go to the store to try them on for better fit. They are really really comfy like walking on marshmallows I love them.
Excellent goods Thanks for the seller
This was a gift for my seven and nine year old nieces. They absolutely love them and say that they are so comfortable. The pink glitter is very fine also, not gaudy. Very fashionable sandals! They don't want to take them off. They have the look and comfort of Birkenstocks for much less. They are both a size 13 and fits them great.
Really cute! My 8 year old loves them. She said they are really comfortable. I love that you can adjust the width, which works great for my daughters wide foot.
These are SO cute if your daughter loves a little bling & leopard!  My 9 year old loves them and I am told they are so fashionable! They are also practical as they have great cushion.
My daughter loves her new sandals<br />So comfy and fashion
Love them!
My daughter hasn't worn these long, so I do not know how they will hold up.  But they are cute and she's happy with them.
My daughter loves them.
These are nice ! Very light weight , they will last a while !
Fit my daughter well, she loves the colors too. She says they are comfy!
My granddaughter liked these. I hope they fit for at least a couple months. Thank god she doesn't grow that fast.
I have typically been satisfied with Skecher shoes for kids.  These were priced less than the typical sneaker and the quality relative to the price was equal.  The shoe is ridiculously light weight and flimsy.  The tread on the bottom of the shoe is subpar.  I wouldn't buy these shoes again, and it makes me hesitant to be Skechers again overall.
My daughter loves them and they fit perfect.
great and beautiful
Nice sneakers
Very light weight, colorful and my 6 yr old loves them!
They were for a 60 year old Downs Syndrome girl who just loves them.
Very pretty shoes. My daughter loves the dainty sparkly design. Lightweight and comfy. Highly recommended.
My daughter is in kindergarten. I bought these at the beginning of the year and she is still wearing them. She wears them daily so they are a little worn down now because of the wear and tear. Will definitely get another pair. They are comfortable for her and she likes the colors.
My daughter likes the shoe very much, she says it's very comfortable!!
We love these shoes and style/design & comfortable fit. This is our second pair. I purchased them a month ago and the Velcro has already separated from the upper strap material. The stitching came out. I am going to say it was a manufacturer defect, and not a common occurance. I plan to contact the seller and/or Amazon to see what kind of warranty there is for such a recent purchase. My son doesn't wear them every day, and uses his baseball cleats for games and practices, so they are still in very good condition/light wear.
Good shoes. My son wears a size 5 but got a size 4 in them. Made a little big.
My son loved these, but the velcro separated from the flap after a few weeks.  The stitching came right out.  Amazon took care of us, but our set was not up to our expectations.
Great fit and shape but my sons wore through the top of the toe area in less then 2 weeks :(
The velcro strap fell apart within the first month of my son wearing them.
This shoe did not even last 4 months. The straps came apart and the hook and loop literally disintegrated. Very very disappointed with the quality.
I purchased these shoes the middle of January. By the middle of February the tongue velcro had separated, then fell off allowing the tongue to slid down in the shoes. Then the next month the strap velcro separated on both shoes rendering the shoes worthless. This isn't the first pair of Skechers shoes that he's had & this happened to. I emailed Skechers & I have to send them back at my expense, then wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement pair. Bottom line I wouldn't buy then & it will be the last pair of Skechers my son will own.
Bought these for my active son.  He loves the look of them.  Now, two months later, the Velcro on the shoes are starting to fall apart.
My 5 year old loves the way this shoe looks and it is easy to put on, but we have had them less than a month and they are already falling apart.  The Velcro strap across the top is fraying and separating (the strap from the Velcro) and the black trim around the sole has completly rubbed off.  I know 5 year old boys are tough on shoes, but I will look for something that holds up better next time
My son loves these and has not had any wear issues.
He loved then
Great fit. Nice sturdy dirt concealing color
Great pair !
Great shoes!
My son loves his new shoes.
Very happy.
The shoes fit great and my son has always loved Skechers, however, the strap going over this shoe broke after just a few weeks.  It detached from the shoe.  Would not purchase again.
The shoes look nice and my 8 year old loves them.
My son loves them!
My child loves them!!!!
These shoes are made with high quality. The lights work great. My kid love the vibrant colors and the comfort. Very happy with this purchase.
My son loves these shoes. How could you not love skechers or light up shoes?
Grandson loved them
Look and fit great!
He loves them, fits great, looks great
My 8 yo son likes these shoes as to fit.  He is a little bit chubby.  He always been a fan of Skechers in terms of fit and design:-)  These serve as his gym shoes in school and he wears them for 2 hours only.  So I have no idea if these will make him comfortable all day.  As for arch support, I am not too sure because I have not asked him questions about arch support:-)  Sorry about the feedback.
They are very light and my 5 year old said they are very comfortable. He loves the lights on them also. Not a heavy shoe. Feels like it is made of foam or something with how light it is.
Fit perfect lights up great colors
my grandson loves these - well made
My Grandson loves them
They look nice, lights are great! The material smells like chemical's, doesn't seem for me healthy at all! Strange, that nobody else noticed?
My son loves the sneakers, the colors match the display the sneaker is true to size.
My grandson loves them.
Great shoe my son loves them!
My Son loves these!!! The lights are super cool too!!! :)
Perfect I loved !!
5 year olds are tough on shoes but so far these have stood up well and the lights are still working, unlike some other light up brands we have tried.
good looking pair of shoes for our active grandson
So far so good! My son loves these pair of shoes.
he was very happy fit well
These are awesome shoes that my son loves since they look great and light up. He never complains of them hurting and plays in them all day long at times. These are his favorite shoes he chooses over all the other ones he has.
My grandson loved these shoes, but only wears shoes for 1 hour or less, Kids!
It's hard to find light up shoes for little boys in bigger sizes, but my 6 year old still loves to wear light up shoes so we were super happy to find these online.  Our last pair of Skechers light ups lasted for a good 6 months of hard use, so we felt they were worth the price.  Love the colors of these new ones.  They are durable and the lights are awesome.  Because of the box they came in, my little guy says they came from outer space which I love.  I hope he'll want light up shoes until he's 16 and I hope Skechers will keep making them!  :)
I have no complaints about these sneakers.  My son has been wearing them for couple of months - they still look new.  He wore them every day to school and now that schools is out, he wears them everywhere else.  They look and feel great!<br />Pros:<br />lightweight<br />vibrant colors with light-up feature - kids love!<br />durable<br />all-day comfort and arch support<br />velcro :) LOL (kids hate shoe-laces... and cats love them too much)<br /><br />When I have to get the next size up for him, I will be buying the same sneakers.  They're $45 - well worth the price - if you consider they don't fall apart after a month, like the last $36 sneakers I purchased - just threw away the money!<br /><br />Cons: None :)
My son loves them.  But, after only a few weeks, the lights on one of the shoes stopped working completely.  Total bummer.  Never had that problem with Sketchers in the past.
I just bought these and my son won't take them off. He is almost 4 years old and he absolutely loves the flashing lights. I cannot attest for the durability of the shoe and its light-up function, but I can say that my son wouldn't even take them off to go to sleep and he has NEVER been that way about a pair of shoes. They have a very cushy sole, and he says that they are very comfortable. He runs and jumps in them all day (although it has only been about a day and a half since he received them). Overall, I am very pleased and I hope they survive the test of time. I bought them about a full size bigger for comfort and growth purposes and it works just fine. I would recommend others do the same. I would def buy again!
My grandson loves the light up feature.
My grandson loves them
I like these skechers too
After 2 weeks already showing some wear and tear. Could be because of the light color and previous darker colored shoes I didn't notice until longer. I'll probably stick with the darker colors next time.
These shoes were bought for a 6 yo boy. They fit great and light up in several colors. He loves the shoes and is very pleased with them.
I don't know about arch support or how long they are comfortable, but my six year old grandson says they're cool and jumps and scooters around in them.
My son loves his shoes ðŸ˜Š
gift ~ loved it
Bought these for my grandson and he loves them!
UPDATE 2: just bought second larger pair, and these shoes are fantastic.  UPDATE:  After wearing these shoes for more than 6 months, almost daily, these shoes are still in great shape.  They are well broken in, and he's outgrowing them.  I really want to buy him the same shoes again because of how great these have been.  May just select a different color.  These shoes fit my 5 year old son perfectly.  He loves them and said that they are super comfortable.
My boy loves them !!!
My son loves these shoes, they did run a bit narrow for him, he is 5 and could just be getting wide feet not sure.
Very happy!
I bought these sneakers for my 5 yr. old grandson and he loves them!
I bought these shoes for my grandson and he loves them.  They are very good quality.
My 3 year old toddler loves these shoes.  But to be fair, he likes anything that lights up.  My son is size 11 and the next step is Kids/Youth size.  It was great to know that Sketchers have this size for my growing boy.
My son loves his new shoes. They're comfortable as well as very cool looking. It also lights up.
Grandson loves them
My wife and I purchased this model for our small five year old son. He has had them now for about seven months, and they do fit well. He indicates that they are comfortable for him to wear at school and loves them. They do have the sizes and widths correct, which is a nice comfort when ordering online. And, the shoes do light up in a rainbow of colors when a specific amount of G force is induced on the sole (ie, .. the kid stomps their foot on the ground). And running down a walk at night induces a nice little trail of flashing LEDs as the child races by. The quality and construction also seem of a high level, as most shoes for him would not last until the seven month mark. One LED is slightly wonky and now only flashes occasionally, but everything else about the shoes is holding up well. For the $33 we paid for them, that equals five stars in my book!
Grandson is very pleased with these shoes.
My son loves these shoes!
very comfortable and light weight for 4 years old kid. I bought 12 M size.
these are light shoes ,nice color ,true to size ..but no arch support ,the light is super bright ,much better than the other pair skechers I have got for my kid.hope the lights will last for awhile .
My son loves these shoes. He is a youth size 1 and they fit him perfectly.
Bought them for my 6 years old son, he loves them, he doesn't want to take them off !!!
Skechers Kids light-Up Sneakers makes my grandson feel like a Super Hero. He loves to run and jump. He feels he is unstoppable
Shoes arrived with sole all bunched up in one shoe.
Cute shoe.  He likes they have lights and velcro
Easy to put on and to take off. Extremely comfortable, my son loves it!
We've purchased Sketchers for our son for many years now. They fit his feet well, most styles light up and most also have velcro. We were excited to find them available on Amazon at competitive prices to our local stores and with a better selection size and style wise. These light up very brightly in all four colors, red, yellow, blue and green like a chasing sequence on Christmas tree lights with every step- it's light, light, light,light in a sort of snail's spiral. Our son loves them and we love the ease of Amazon Prime!
My 5 year old adores his shoes. I like that he can put them on and take them off by himself. This is a great but.
My son loves it. Good quality and material. We went to Skechers local store and they were impressed with it, it was not available in store anyway. Lights are bright enough to bring happiness to my child.
My little guy loves them! For reference he has wide, somewhat flat feet. Skechers have a really great fit for him.
Great!
My 4-year-old son has NEVER been excited about shoes until these arrived. We had no idea they were light up shoes, but they are clearly super cool for my preschooler. The first day he ran around the house in just his underwear and shoes!! He even made me save the box. Sadly, my 8-year-old is too cool for light up shoes, so his pair is going back.
Excellent . My son loves it.
I love it
Great shoe I would buy them again.
My son LOVES his shoes, and the light up feature has him dancing, so cute!
Birthday gift for 5yo daughter and she likes them a lot.  They look better in person while being worn than expected.
School shoes. She hasn't worn them yet.
The shoes are great! But the light up function does not last very long. We got about 8 months of use out of these.
These are great! My daughter loves them. They fit nicely and the lights are not obnoxious like some shoe lights
Good
Excellent
Excellent Shoes. Very easy to put on. My daughter loves them.
My child goes through shoes in almost a month, this brand is the only one that doesn't wear out soooo quickly.  My daughter loves the lights and the sparkly colors.
These are just TOO CUTE! I love them and so does my daughter. I wasn't sure what size to order since I am not familiar with how Sketchers run, but I took a guess and they fit her feet. I will say that of the 3 pairs of shoes I ordered (all at the same time/same size) these ran the smallest. My daughter loves all things purple, pink and sparkly where as I like to have a more neutral shoe that we can &#34;wear with anything&#34;. This was a great choice. Fun for her but can be worn with a variety of outfits.
My 4.5 yr old is thrilled with these shoes.  She loves the light up feature.  We have had them for about 2 weeks.  She wears them all the time and hasn't had any issues with them.
Just what we thought and the girls love the lights!
A gift for my niece and she loves them!
8 yr old daughter's favorite color is pink & purple and into sparkly things.  This shoe is perfect and the lights are bright!  She loves it!
Looks just like the picture. My five yr old loves it.
excelente shoes my daughter love it. me too. small for the size.
Nice, my grand daugther like it so much
I bought these for my 4-year-old granddaughter who wanted light-up shoes.  She loves them and they appear to be very sturdy and well-made.
Beautiful design and colors! My daughter loved them! They are light weight and comfortable! Bought them for $20, great deal!
Very nice shoe.
My daughter loves these, and doesn't want to take them off. We have normally gotten the twinkle toes version, but these at the time were such a good deal I thought we would try them. Infact, I may go ahead and by a few other sizes and different colors now while the price seems to be low. Last week they were at a higher price.
My daughter is in a size 3 right now, so I bought 3 1/2 hoping to get through the school year. She could barely get her toes into the shoe.
My girls love it and they say it's super comfortable and the lights are just a delight for them. Endless fun with their sneakers, they did not want to take it off at bedtime. 4 star is just because I am not sure of its durability for now
I am very upset with this item. My daughter typically LOVES Skechers light ups and when she took her surprise out of the box, she initially did until she put them on this morning and started counting how many jewels were missing on the tops of the shoes.
for a little princess
my son loved these shoes!!  he wore them until they were worn out.  These have been his favorite shoes, took a while to werar them out, but will now need to buy him anther pair.
Bought a pair,  looked brand new but one of the shoe never worked ...was taking a flight the following day for Europe so no time to exchange !!!very very disappointed!!!
Great fit and style of shoe, but only one shoe lights up.  If they worked as expected, then they would have received a five star.
The workmanship was not good on one of the pairs.  My grandson put them on to wear them to the state fair and half way through the day a piece of the material of the top toe seam of the shoe came off literally.  So, now you can put your finger into the inside of the shoe from the top.  This is ridiculous as they were very expensive.  I would like a replacement but do not know how to return them for reimbursement or replacement.  If someone could help me out, I would appreciate it.  They were the size 3 shoes.  I hope this gets into the hands of the right person.  Thank you.
Only one of the shoes light up.  There is an on/off button for the lights but on the left foot the light only works when you press the button not when walking.
my son loved these.  He ran around in them from the time we received them, showing off the lights.  Great purchase!
The lights work perfectly on ours, unlike other reviewers I have read. One shoe is blue or orange, the other shoe can be red or green. My son's favorite colors are red and blue, so he loves that he can wear these shoes and get both of his fav colors at the same time. We are on our second pair and they hold up as well as any sneaker would for a 5 year old.
We love them! My son is happy. Great price, shipped and arrived fast. Will be ordering more for back to school.
My son has worn these shoes for 5 weeks and the front of the shoe is completely torn open from one side to the other . Never again.
Neither I or my little one like these shoes anymore as they lasted about a month only. I would never buy skechers for him.
We liked it but needed to go half size up.
My 6 year old loves these. They are durable, flashy, and comfortable. A+
Beautiful
Shocking poor quality! My son has only worn them a few times, and they are already falling apart. Some trim along the front had come loose. The shiny material around the toe had flaked off.
I bought these shoes through a local retailer and within a 6 weeks the material completely broke away from the toes on both shoes, the soles shed rubber like crazy, the lights are not working properly with one light on at all times, and they don't absorb foot sweat well at all.. My son's feet sweat so his shoes don't always smell too great, but these shoes smelled TERRIBLE within a week!! I was shocked and he hadn't even been wearing them regularly. I've never had so many issues with a pair of shoes for my son and typically can get 6-8 months out of a pair of sneakers. I figured spending $50 on these Sketchers would be a good investment but I was wrong.
These shoes look just as described but it's been a month and these shoes are already showing signs of wear and tear. Not worth the money
My grandson loves these shoes. Light-Up colors are so fun...so many options. Unfortunately, it got really went one stormy day and one of the shoes never lit up again :(
My son loves them :)
I bought these shoes for my youngest grandson last Fall and they were such a hit that I bought the same shoes for my older grandson in January, 2015.  The toes of the shoes bought in January wore out in less than a month (while the first pair wore well, even after 7 months)! The blue plastic embossed material in the toe area did not hold up to a 5 year old's play.  I spoke to the company and was told that this was a manufacturer's defect that has been fixed on the new shoes.  So, I returned the worn shoes to Amazon and ordered a new pair direct from Sketchers.  I received them this week, and the blue embossed materials looks just the same on the new ones as on the ones that wore right out, whereby the shoes bought last Fall appear to have a hard, clear plastic covering on the blue embossed material. Which may be why the first pair wore so well, and the second pair did not.  So, we will try again.  The problem I may have, however, is that the new pair is a size larger than the first pair, so we will not know if they wear well until he grows into them!  Darn.
My son loves these shoes
Child loves her Sketchers
These are my favorite and my girls favorite as well.  Love them.
my daughter loves these shoes!
I purchased these for my 6 yr old daughter for school and she loves them! She has told me that they are very comfortable, and has no issue wearing them all day! The colors are perfect to go with any cute capris, pants, etc.They have a durable, cushioned sole that will last through a year with an active 6 yr old. The best part of these shoes is the drawstring adjustable heel to provide a perfect heel fit so there is no rubbing and blisters! My daughter has always gotten blisters on her heels with slip- ons, and this is the first pair of slip-ons that she has never gotten one .<br />I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a stylish, yet comfortable and durable slip -on shoe and or has had problems with heels slipping and rubbing.
Looks great but runs a little big.
These ended up being a little large so we are hanging on to them and hoping she will grow into them soon,
I bought these for my 7 year old daughter.  They run a little big and we had to exchange them for a half size smaller but they are so cute and she says they are comfy.  She loves them.  It's hard to find good spring/summer shoes for her because at school and summer day camp, they are not allowed to wear open toes or open heels.  These are canvas and still have good rubber soles so they are perfect.
These shoes run a little big.  I bought a size 13 for my daughter and they fit more like a 13 1/2.  She loves them.
The product meets my expectations. Excellent.
I bought these in July or August for her to wear with her school uniform. We haven't had the chance to wear these yet as they seem to run big on my daughter's feet.  They are adorable and we are waiting patiently until they fit properly.
Very cute shoes! My daughter loved them!
nice shoe
Great support and superb fit, my little girl loves these for running around in. Not to bulky, they are perfect. And cute, too!
love these shoes
My granddaughter loves them!
They are so cute! My daughter is in love with them
Great
my daughter loves these!

Nice Shoes by Sketchers
Great looking sneakers. Colors are great. Fit is perfect. Two pair of shoe laces were included. One white and one tie dye.
Good shoes, but they are a little narrow
Nice design but shoe lace keeps dropping.
Daughter loves them, except for the flat laces. She can't keep those tied :-)
My daughter seems to like these so far, but has only worn them a few times. We bought them for a cute, casual shoe to wear to school and running around. They are similar to a Ked's. Very nicely packaged and even came with a few other add-ons (ponytail, donation to a cause). Good value for the money we paid. Love the tie-die colors which will match with most anything.
So beautiful and confortable shoes, I bought a pair of this for my doughter and she is so happy... I recomended it!!
Very good
My daughter loves them))
Brilliant looking but not es well quality as expected.
Run a tee bit big
my daughter loves them!
These are for my niece and she absolutely loves them. I'm not sure if they are comfortable for her but during the cold days she wore them often. I will only say the only discomfort seems to come to whoever has the privilege of being stepped on. Those boots hurt.<br /><br />And again mostly for the person who is putting on her shoes it was somewhat hard to handle. Keep in mind these are shoes for kids, if they wear them just know they will wear them again.
Great shoes! The ONLY BRAND I buy for my kids & myself! Th fit is very accurate, and they hold up for me for years! My tough & rough kids, they still hold up & withstand the beating these shoes take! And still look GREAT!<br />I HIGHLY recommend these and every other shoes made by SKECHERS!
The kids loved it!
Great! My daughter needed all black sneakers for school. I love that these are still cute and girly!
Great kids sneaker!
100% recomended.Very good
Daughter loved these shoes!
Adorable!  My daughter loves them!
Very cute but way to tight!
My daughter likes that it lights up but she told me the shoe is heavy when she walks compared to her other shoes. I did check and it is noticable that this type of shoe is heavier than the other Skechers we own.
Got them for my 7 year old great granddaughter. She loves them.
My daughter was very excited to get these shoes.  They are very pretty.  The soles are very thick, do not bend easily, and make the shoes pretty heavy.  My daughter doesn't seem to mind.  I think it bothers me more than it does her.
Good
Great purchase and seller!
Love them
my daughter loves these shoes
These shoes fell apart after only 6 months. The bottoms came off and the fabric on the top ripped off. My daughter didn't even wear them on a daily basis.
My daughter loved them...she is a twinkle toes girl.
daughter loves these sneakers would buy again
Perfect size for my daughter.
My grandson love's them
Hello. I receive the wrong size. The left foot is OK (1 US or 32 EUR), but the right foot NO (12 US or 28 EUR). So how you can help me to send you the wrong size (right foot) and receive the right size (1 US or 32 EUR).
My so loves them wanted to wear them the first day of school mind you it was 100 degrees out...Great delivery time will order again....
I love them so cute on my son!
My son feels so grown up in these. They look good and feel comfortable.
i love it
they were scuffed up the first day. so a very expensive pair of workshoes--that were suppose to be for school.
Good but comes a little bigger than you  expect
Bought these for my 8 year old son who's spending his summer working with Dad.  He's on his feet all day, climbing hills, in the dust dirt and mud.  he loves these boots.  Much better than the cowboy boots and tennis shoes he has been wearing.
good deal
My 8 year old loves these work boots like dad wears.The price is great & they're a nice looking boot.
excelente
My son loves them!
These shoes are so cute!  My son loves them.
My 4 year old loves them so much! They are pretty cool shoes.
My 6 yrs old son loves them. Nice color.
Perfect boys sneakers true to size.
My son love it.
Everything went perfect
Only had a couple of weeks and the (S) on the side of the shoe is peeling off.
Did not last well. Heavy metal springs on bottom wore through rubber. My 9- yo son is gentle on his shoes, too.<br />Too pricy for this quality.
Excellent!
My son loves these sneakers!!!  I was a little afraid of the sole but he can walk and run in them just like any other sneaker!!
My son (8) absolutely loves these shoes. They are worth the money
These shoes look really cool.  My son and I loved the way they looked online.  We got the black and light blue ones because they look like something Batman would wear :) When they arrived he was delighted, but I was a little disappointed.  Skechers usually makes a sturdy shoe. These look, thinner? More like a lighter weight runner's shoe. Some people might like a lighter shoe, but not me.  When it comes to my son I buy skechers Bc they are solid with a thick rubber.  These run small.  My son is a size 2 so definitely ordered a 2 and a half. Don't expect them to hold up long.  But my son loves them so 4 stars
Perfect, came as described
Great shoes !
My Son loves these shoes,  and likes showing how &#34;fast&#34; the springs make him.  They are meant for school,  but he wants to wear them all the time,  despite it being summer.  They seem solidly built,  and are very attractive in person.  My experience w zig zag Velcro is they fail,  so this design,  with just the piece of Velcro across the top and stretchy laces is a superior design in my opinion.
Nice shoes. I gave it 4 stars because they are heavy.
So far, these are wearing well.
My son love these sneakers.
Good!
Great shoe
My son loves theses shoes.  However, as many others have reported, the bottom wears out quickly.  He has had them for about a month and the yellow tread is already wearing off.  Definitely not the same quality as other Sketchers he has had.
Horrible Design and only lasted about 3/4 weeks on my 5 year old.  Not enough rubber on the sole and wore out to sharp rigged plastic in only a few weeks.<br /><br />Should have listened to the other reviewers.  $$ down the drain.<br /><br />Now on a positive note, Sketchers makes some of the longest lasting kids shoes and this will not deter me from a future purchase, but i will look closer at design and reviews next time
I love the shoes on my son and he loves thme too.
Good so far
My son likes a lot. It looks like very comfy for him, but little bit heavy to me.
my son loves them they are so comfortable
In addition to fitting well, they look nice too.  Now the test will be how long they hold up on my son who goes through shoes like they are tissues.
returned purchased wrong size
My 7 year old sneaker critic loves them.  Great fit
The shoe size was supposed to be a size 6, but I got a little kids shoe, instead of big kids shoe.
tight at the heel other than that good shoe
Cool looking shoe and my son loves it but they are a very heavy sneaker.
I would not buy these shoes for a grade school-age child. I bought two pairs of the Skechers Mega Blade Sneakers; one for my 4-year-old and one for my 7-year-old. The pair for my 4-year-old (who is in preschool) has performed and worn as expected. However, my 7-year-old's pair has completely fallen apart to the point that they absolutely have to be replaced. I received the shoes on 3/25/2015. By May 25, 2015, one of the shoes had lost both springs and the supporting columns under the heel such that there is now nothing supporting his heel on that shoe. I even received a call from school requesting that I bring a different pair of shoes for him to wear as it is difficult for him to walk and run in the shoes as is. I paid $53.00 for a pair of shoes that should have lasted through the summer, however only lasted for two months. My 7-year-old used these shoes at school, which includes gym class and recess. Other than that, the shoes were not put through any &#34;extreme&#34; use.
Excellent tennis shoes and the right size. Highly recommended. Perfect fit. Good materials. Good quality. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good tennis shoes.
Heels wore out in less then a month. Definitely don't recommend.
Sealed brand new Awesome!!
My son loves these shoes and they do look very cool. He's been wearing them daily for about 2 weeks now and the blue paint on the sides of the soles is almost completely worn off, it's only painted blue on top of the neon yellow/green sole. They look very worn after only two weeks and my son isn't very hard on his shoes. If you let your kid pick out the shoes, this is what you get! I would have picked a more durable brand, but this is what he wanted. I'll try to update on the durability in the near future.
Fits perfect and looks great! Can't say anything more as it is the first day.
My son loves these sneakers, they are as comfortable as they are stylish!
My 8yo son loves how these shoes look, but sadly even he was shocked out how quickly they've gotten worn. After wearing them for a week and a half, the rubber on the heels had completely worn away on the edges, leaving just hard plastic exposed. That plastic is already getting sharpened into a hard edge, and it's pretty clear the rest of the thin rubber on the heel is doomed. (Zoom in on the image of the new shoe and you can see how thin that pad is.)<br /><br />We've had lots of other Skechers that we've liked and that have worn much better, but this is a design flaw on this model.
This is the second pair of Skechers I've purchased for my 6 year old, and he loves them.  No complaints about the fit, and he wears them all day including long days at school.  So far they've held up very well, and he's rough on shoes.
EXCELENTE
Exactly as expected.  Brand new in box.
It's been just two months, and my son is already complaining that the Velcro won't stay closed. He says it's always popping open when he runs or plays. I'm very annoyed that I have to start shopping for sneakers again. Sneakers also have springs in the heel, which I think just makes it heavy and clunky, not light and springy.
One of the best quality sneakers for my child I've ever purchase. Once again Amazon &#34;ROCKS&#34;
My son has been wearing sketchers for the past five years. He really enjoys the color of this pair.
Wonderful kids sneaker, shipped promptly and stitched well. Can see this sneaker lasting more than just the summer.
Don't buy this one...line decals started coming off within a month and a spring from the sole came out within 5 months. It is the worst Sketchers style we have purchased over the last 10 years. Mother of 3 boys!
My son  loves these shoes!! The color is vibrant and cool!!
son loves the shoes (green favorite color)!!  my only complaint is the green on the outside of the sole is already coming off.
my son like it very much..
My son love these shoes very nice color and comfortable.
My grandson liked this shoes, they are one of his favorite, no problems.
Great shoes!! Well made and my son loves them :)
my boy loves this shoes, he fills comfortable all day!<br />Are the only shoes he likes and feels confortable
Great shoes! My son loves them
My son LOVES these shoes!
My son is flat footed and has pain when he walks.. He loves these shoes !! His words are &#34;feels like he is walking on air&#34;
We love them!
Beautiful shoe in appearance however this one is narrow. I purchased a size 2.5 and length wise their was plenty of room but width wise he said it was punching his sides. So I ended up having to send back.
Really soft and light
Grandson loves them. They are very pretty and look very nice. Very comfortable. Grandson said that he was walking on Clouds! LOL!
I purchased these shoes for my 7 year old. They are very good looking shoes and like all skechers, very comfortable to wear. I like the fact that they look like lace up shoes but have the velcro strap for ease of use. A really good deal!
My son loves them.
My son loves these shoes. He finds them to very comfortable, and was excited about the memory foam insole. His words &#34;I am super fast at Tag in these shoes&#34;.
Bought these for son, who loves the foam cushion soles.
My son loved it.
Daughter loves these.
Good shoe so far, but my daughter has to tighten the strap pretty tight. I didn't realize these shoes came with no tie and just a Velcro strap to tighten them do they tend to be a little wide.
These shoes are so cute and my 5 yr old absolutely loves them!!
My daughter loves these shoes they are So cute and made very well!
good shoe love the brand
They are well loved and popular.  My 7y.o. is thrilled!
my son loves these shoes. Lots of red, blue and white lights. Be warned ;)
Excellent
Bought these shoes for gym class but are much to heavy for small children to be running in.
My child absolutely loves these shoes. He's been wearing them all school year and they are just now starting to wear out from so much use! I will definitely be buying these again for him!
different kind of shoes! my kid loves these!
Good
My daughter loved it
Cute, cute shoes.  Unfortunately, my daughter has not been able to wear them because they are too large.  She's a solid size one.  The size 1's are too big to wear.
Great shoes,she loves them
My daughter weara a size 12 so I purposely bought the 13 for her to wear this summer. They are a little big so its perfect for her to start wearing in a couple months.
Great price for great shoes. They really are comfortable and light weight, and our Skechers always last a long time.
got these for my son who loves orange.  They fit him well.  He's got a pretty standard foot width for his length.  So far, so good..not sure how they'll hold up to his torturing of them, but for now, a good buy.
Not well made at all my son has some these for 3 days and already has holes in the front of them I buy skechers for the durability of them and these are the worst shoes by far may as well bought a wm brand since these did the same as this would have very upsetting
Shoes are not sturdy. Outdoor play for 2 days and they already had holes in the toes. Not worth it!
I bought these sneakers at a department store, not Amazon. However, they were falling about by week 2.  I finally took them back to the store at week 5 after the toe of the shoe ripped.  DO NOT BUY!
good one!
I don't often write reviews, but this product warrants one. On a positive note, I loved the blue color of these shoes. They hid dirt very well. More importantly,however, these shoes only last 1-1/2 months before completely falling apart. I have a very active 9 year old who wears these shoes almost every day. He plays hard like most boys....but I can't believe the shoes are already falling apart after only a month and a half of wear. The rubber sole came apart (peeled away) from the toe of the shoe to the middle of the shoe. I am so disappointed. I would not recommend wasting your money on these shoes.
large
Orange is my grandson's favorite color, so of course, i had to order these shoes for him. Glad i did. He loves them!. They fit him well, are comfortable and look good. Fast shipping was also appreciated.
My son is very happy with these shoes, which means I'm happy too!
My son lives them. Exactly what he wanted.
i love it.
Excellent business
Cute shoes, I wish they'd worked. Sadly, despite all the other size 11 shoes fitting my son with room, we couldn't even squeeze these on.
smaller then I expected, lucky me that i always buy half size bigger.
Very comfortable shoes for my 7 years old son
Fit as expected and my on loves them
First of all super cute. The insoles are gel infused memory foam which is great for kids running around all day and they came with an extra set of laces, purple. Bought these for my 6yr old daughter for school, I ordered her usual size (12) and they fit perfectly.
Very good! Wear appropriate comfortable! The price also is very favourable. Amazon is great!
My son love them.We like to were them even he is sleeping.
They need to make these more available in larger sizes. The only shoes my son loves.
Super cute for our little boys. We ordered two different colors and they love them. Fits great.
Love them
These were super cute but a tad too big. I was so sad I had to return them
Super cute and lights work for more than a day or two.  Great buy the zippers are awesome!
My daughter loves them!
Bought this for my daughter, she loves them .
Really cute. My daughter loves using the side zippers to make it easy to get them on and off
Stiff but cute. They are not her favorites but we keep them as a back up pair.
I got these for my little girls birthday and they were perfect and she loves them!
My daughter loooove this so much esp the fact that it is so easy to put on because of the zipper ! Great idea!
My daughter loves them!  Fit as expected.
Bought these sneakers for my granddaughter.  They are a bit small on her fit and a bit narrow.  Hopefully, she'll get some wear out of them before she grows out of them.
Great product. Great price. Thanks
Awesome! Shoes were as described
Nice shoes
I got these shoes for my daughter, she loves them
Nice and cute for my daughter. They came quickly<br />And was exactly what I expected
My daughter has been using them and they are perfect. She loves them and can easily use them  all day with no discomfort at all.
My daughter loves them.
Poor workmanship and materials. Canvas to sole seam began to tear after wearing only two times for short period of time. Amazon provided full refund upon return.
My daughter absolutely loves these shoes.
I wish in light up shoes there was a place to turn the light off as if there is I haven't figured it out yet. They are very cute and Im hoping to figure out the lighting aspect since for older kids who like the shoes but the light make them very young feel and she doesn't like that.
My daughter absolutely LOVES these shoes! The zipper on the side is nice because she's still learning how to tie and for those mornings when we are hurried, she can still use the zipper to get them on by herself. She loves the light up toes especially. They came with an extra pair of shoe laces, which was really nice also. The tongue is pretty thin and has no padding so I had to teach her to pull it up when she puts them on. I think these are a really great purchase.
My daughter loves them! The fit is perfect and she says they are very comfortable. It is hard to find a shoe that lights up in big kid sizes, but this is perfect!!! She stomped around the house this morning making them light up!!! :) And as fast as little feet grow, the price was just right.
My daughter loves the shoes. .. the only thing is that they came in tooo big... i will exchsnge them for a smaller size. Great girl sniker!
My daughter loves them.  Last time I bought Twinkle Toes only one of them lit up.  Glad I didn't have a problem with these
These light up shoes are adorable! My daughter can't tie her shoes yet so the zipper portion makes it easy to get on and off!!
Exelente
Fine
Best uniform shoes I have bought for my daughter yet!
Very Good, but somewhat large
I purchased this shoe for my granddaughter. She's really heavy on her feet. This shoe is perfect for the school year.
Comfortable school ðŸ« shoes
Fit as expected. The shoes are not comfortable will working. Should not have purchased for work!!
Great product!!
Size and color and style are great..
My granddaughter loves these shoes and none of her friends have the same ones since we got them online.
I want a small one,small one size
Gift for my granddaughters birthday
It not correspond to size chart in cm
Shoes are super cute, but did not hold up. within a month of normal wear to school the sole of the shoe was flimsy and wearing very badly. This is not the first pair of this brand of shoe my daughter has worn and the last pair lasted several months. The top of the shoe where the lights are also started to tear and fray on one. Not what I would have expected.
Cutest shoes ever with all the bling my granddaughter needs to top off her outfits.
very nice but not that confortable
My little one loved her new twinkle toes, they seem comfortable and sutabable to her shoes size ðŸ‘
Got this for my 3 yr old daughter she can fit a 8 1/2 but I got her a 9 n there's good enough room for her to grow into thumbs up! She loves the lights and over all design. We will see how long this shoes durability will last.
In love with these!
My daughter is happy
These shoes are absolutely adorable and my daughter loves them!
Love theses, soooo cute
She love it! Look so fancy and are comfortable for her.
Great fit, great timing, and great price!!
Very cute but runs small an narrow
Super cute my daughter can't wait for school to start to wear them.
The most beautiful shoes i have ever purchased!!! My girl loves it. Perfect design and very comfy! Recommend it without hesitation!
She loves them. Cute and comfortable and surprisingly easy to put on and take off.
It was very cute when it came. Today is her seconed time to wear these sneakers. It start to rotten. Very disappointed with the quality.Want to return them if they can.
Got the shoes for my 5yr old niece. It was the perfect shoes they have everything going on. My niece is a princess type of girl so she enjoyed the rhinestones glitter lights bow.Perfect for girlly girls.
Very cute!
so cute
was as expected
[[VIDEOID:1111d7e6cd960bc9a99d955fd58e78a]] Well these shoes would have gotten 5 stars but when I received them one of the shoes did not light up and now I can't send them back because they are my daughters school shoes I am hoping the company will send a replacement pair and then I can send these back but who knows. I am really bummed they didn't light up on one cause the shoes are BEAUTIFUL and my little girl will look very cute in them but of course you can't go to school with only one shoe lighting up
Darling, well made.
I bought these for my 2 year old granddaughter who loves the twinkle toes.  I measured her foot on a professional measuring pad.  She measures size 6 1/2 so I got the size 7.  They are waaaay too big, but I'm keeping them.<br />The shoes are absolutely darling and I love them.  I haven't shown them to her yet because she will want to wear them now.
Love them !!! My daughter loved them soooo much :)
You can't go wrong with a cute pair of shoes like these. They are a gift for my daughter who has not seen them yet. My only issue is the images show a zipper on the side which is part of why I loved them as she cannot yet tie her own shoes. I guess this will be when we learn and maybe motivation to learn quick because she can't wear them to school unless she can tie them herself.
My granddaughter adores these!  They fit well and are so cute!
Love the shoes but one shoe does not light up and my daughter was disappointed .
Bought this for my 20 mo daughter. It's her first time wearing a light up shoes. She is so excited. Fits well. They send an extra pair of blue shoe lace in case you don't like the pink satin lace. They are very very pretty. Will be useful for winter too!
They arrived on time...they are adorable
My daughter loved the shoes!
Cute
Really cute, my daughter loves them and they look great with everything!
Beautiful and very well fit.super cute
The jewels that light up on the toes aren't in the right spot. They sent me two different sizes because nobody could be bothered to do a quality control check before they were sent!  The fabric around them is over lapping them and looks like the jewels are going to be completely covered by fabric with everyday wear. Also, came with a second set of laces, teal ones, in case you want to swap out the pink. Well the teal ones are two different lengths!! Don't buy these online. I would only buy another pair for my daughter if I could see them in person first.
Quality is not what was described. The shoe has glitter that falls off. At this price you would be better off choosing a different shoe or buying glue to seal the glitter.
I purchased these shoes direct from Amazon (toddler 5, hot pink and purple)  They are so cute and fit just right but they didn't light up properly.  I exchanged the shoes thinking it was just a bad pair, but both times the right shoe wouldn't light up (both pairs the left shoe was fine).  They don't have any more in stock so I can't exchange them a third time to try to get a pair that works.  I gave them two stars because they are absolutely adorable and look really cool when they light up properly.  They are just too expensive to keep if they don't do what they are supposed to.
Somewhat large, but actually perfect for growing into. My 8 year old LOVES these! Super cute!
Beautiful shoes... My daughter will wear hem for her 4th bday party. She couldn't wait I put them on
These have to be the cutest shoes ever! My daughter immediately wanted to put them on as soon as they came!
My 18m granddaughter loves these sketchers!! The fact that they also LITE up when she runs or walks, look out park here she comes! Lol ;)
My favorite yet.
Love them so adorable she has to wait till school starts!
Beautiful shoes!  Grandkids LOVED them !  So feminine !
My little girl LOVES these! I was waiting and waiting and waiting for her to grow out of her last pair of Skechers light up sneakers to justify buying these. I am sooo glad that I did! When these arrived, I let her open them herself. And I gotta tell you, these must be awesome because she actually spent more time giggling and trying to put her new shoes on than she did playing with the box. Which is a huge thing for my two year old. These are so much fun and well detailed. I love the little foiled heart print on the sides. We purchased the pink and purple pair and they came with two different pairs of laces so to make these extra funky, we laced one pair with pink laces and the other with the purple laces. They are very durable. My daughter can run around in these all day on pavement, dirt, grass, &#34;you name it&#34; - with zero complaints. The also don't attract dirt as much as some of her other shoes and still look brand spanking new after daily use of over a month. She actually asks to put on this specific pair of shoes to go outside. The only downside is that these don't come in adult sizes so I could channel my inner Cyndi Lauper.
Cute sneakers!  My 2 year old daughter loves them.
The shoes are too cute and are my granddaughter's favorite. The shoe looks just as cute as the picture.  Beware the shoes run a little large, she's in a 9 in most other shoes and I purchased these in a 9 and they are a little big.  I decided to keep them and let her grow into the shoe.
Design is a little disappointment cursor is pretty good in size than the others.
My daughter and I love these! Just wish there was a zipper on the side so the laces didn't have to be tied.
Very satisfied with my purchase.
My dauther love it so much she so happy to get it
My daughter adores these shoes. All of her friends want to get them too!
Im in love with these skeches
Love it
My daughters shoes came in smashed up box and the twinkle toe part looks sank in an kinda used looks like someone tried to replace the twinkle part but didn't do a great job . And these where school shoes so I had to go purchase more shoes ..
Awesome! Great! fits nice and looks cool. Thanks again and God Bless.
Excelent, the lights are very very very bright but my daughter love it. It fits somewhat large but she can use it anyway
espectaculares
A little big bit a nice sneaker
My daughter is absolutely in love with these shoes. They fit great and she loves the bling bling :)
Everything about it was just perfect!!! Great quality. My daughter is 7 and she uses them every day for school and she is very picky when it comes to shoes. We are very happy with this purchase.
My daughter LOVES them.
Daughter was very excited and wears them to school everyday.  She comes home and tells me about all the complements she received :)
My 18 month old niece, has a high instep & chubby feet. Shoes are so hard to find that fit her comfortably.<br />She normally wears Stride Rite size 5 Wide Width, but these 5 Medium Width Sketchers fit with room to grow.<br />These Sketchers sneakers run about a 1/2 size larger and a little wider than most medium toddler shoes, which is great especially for toddlers new to walking. With the adjustable Velcro strap it makes it open wide so they are easy to get on & off her little cherub feet.<br />These shoes are so sparkly & absolutely gorgeous in person. I also bought the Sketchers Kids 10451N Twinkle toe Sneaker in charcoal (same fit).<br />They are constructed well, with great support.<br />She loves them, so does Mom. ANY little girl will LOVE them. Her brother even loves them, he says &#34;They sparkle like diamonds&#34;!
My baby love this shoe,this is a beautiful shoe
Super cute, i loved.
My 6 almost 7 year old LOVES these shoes.  We get compliments on them everywhere and from everyone...all ages.<br /> I got them for Xmas but she's taken to wearing them with dresses, skirts, and tshirts and shorts as well.
They're for my daughter. We looked all over out town for this design and couldn't find them anywhere. In the first five minutes on Amazon we found them. She loves them and that's all that matters to me. They're incredibly durable, she wears them almost every day and last at least the entire school year! Awesome shoes and Amazon is awesome!!
I JUST THOUGHT MY DAUGHTER WOULD WEAR THIS SIZE SO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU BUY BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO WEAR THEM ONCE AND THEY WERE HUGE SHE IS 8. I BOUGHT A SIZE 1 TOO BIG SHE NEEDS A 12 BUT HER 12 SHOES FIT HER TIGHT WEIRD?
cute shoes and very comfortable :)
Great sneakers for kids! Very lightweight and fun bouncy looking soles!
my daughter loves these. says they are very comfortable
Granddaughter loves them!
Cute but didn't hold up well.  The bottom &#34;bubbles&#34; on the soles ripped after about a week.  She says the memory foam was super comfy.
Soles are coming apart from the shoes after one week of wearing to school.
Very cute!!
These shoes are pretty however, due to the rough surface these shoes are nearly impossible to clean.
My daughter chose it, and loved it the moment she wear it.
These are wonderful!!!  I have small feet . . really small.  I wear a 4.  In children's shoes I wear a 3.  I wore these every day for  3 weeks while walking the cobblestone  streets of old Hungary and the Czech Republic. My feet never tired nor did my legs or back.  The memory foam insole and the arch support was amazing!  I LOVE Sketchers!!!
excelente
i got these shoes and they were good for about a month then they started ripping and getting dirty. For what I payed it's not worth it.
Bought for my 4 year old granddaughter she loves them.  Vivid colors and she says they are comfortable.
Only complaint is the cloth nature of the shoes isn't very durable for kids.  Worn 2-weeks and front is wearing a bit.
Perfectly fit and great for running.
Nice she it happyðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
Awesome!!!
Kid loves it.
My 9 year old daughter loves these shoes!  She wore them on vacation and kept commenting on how great they felt.  I have had some issues with the quality of Sketchers in the past so time will tell how long these will last. So far so good after 2 months1
she said that it feel like she is walking on the clouds
Same toe scraping issue as other reviewers mentioned. This was after the first two days that my 5 year old wore them. They look terrible. Will not buy Sketchers again.
My daughter (7 y/o) absolutely loves these shoes.  At first she just thought they look great, but then all I started hearing was how comfortable they are.  They seem pretty well made, but I've seen problems with Sketchers in the past of not holding up.  Hopefully it won't be the case with these!
Ok
Gran-daughter loves them!
The fabric quickly ripped in several places on the shoe, making them look old.
My daughter loves these shoes.
My daughter looooved these shoes!  I told her that she had a bouncy sole (the rubber) so she walked around showing everyone how high she could jump in her new shoes!! lol  The only downfall is that she is hard on shoes, as most 5 year olds may be, and the cloth outlining of the shoes got holes and skids on them very quickly.  But overall, great shoes!
daughter likes them
Daughter loves them
Perfect for my daughter who needs soft comfy shoes
Very comfortable shoes, fit as expected.  However, the front fabric of this shoes teared open after the third day. Cannot return them any more.
We loved these shoes but after less than a month the front of both shoes fell apart. It is a fabric and not very durable for young kids.
Worth the wait
Very pleased with the sneaker
Good
My 10 year old loves them.  She does say they feel a bit odd when she first puts them on, the memory foam takes a couple minutes to mold maybe, that doesn't to bother much though.
These are really cute shoes I purchased for my 6 yo. She likes them as much as I do.
My 5 year old loves them !
My daughter LOVES these shoes! They fit her perfectly and are very, very comfortable!
I love the sneaker but only after a few days the rubber in the front began wearing away.
The front of this shoe doesn't have any extra protection, like other shoes.  My daughter (6) wore these for less than 24 hours, outside typically playing and the front of the shoe was destroyed!  I would not recommend these to any parent!
My five year old loves them.  The colors are what is in the picture.
My 7 year old daughter loves these!  We were back to school shopping and she tried them on at Academy, but they didn't have her size.  Amazon to the rescue!  So cute and she seems to think they were instantly comfortable with no break in time.  She wears them to school nearly everyday so she can play tag at recess.
Beautiful and well made sneakers. My daughter loves it.
everything fine and my daughter love it!
Great shoes grandaughter loves them will buy more soon.  It's hard to find cute shoes for small feet. Skechers do it well.
My granddaughter loves them!
My 8 year old gives these 5 stars! She says they are really comfortable and bouncy. There was no break in, felt great right out of the box. The fushia and turquoise color combo is vibrant, the material looks sturdy and the shoe is well constructed. She loves that there is a Velcro strap and elastic laces even though she can tie laces she likes just popping her shoes on and off quickly.
Great comfy playground shoes. My 6-year old granddaughter loves the memory foam insoles.
FABULOUS!!!
My 5 year old loves these shoes! She was so excited!  I've never seen her more excited about anything else! She said &#34;they bounce!&#34; and did not want to take them off for a while. She's been asking me for bouncy shoes but I had no idea what she was talking about until she showed them to me at the store. Unfortunately, they didn't have her size, so we had to find them on Amazon.
My 6-year-old loves the look of the Skechers sneakers and they're quite comfortable. She's had three pairs now. They don't hold up nearly as well as the Puma, Nike, or Stride Rite shoes we've tried, though. The ornamentation quickly deteriorates, making the shoes look old and beat up after a month---and she's not wearing the same shoes every day. They're too expensive to hold up that poorly.
Love these shoes and the memory foam.  Very comfortable for my little one.
Love them and daughter loves them. A little bubbly on the soles. But that makes them super comfy according to my daughter. Fits great.
Excelent decision if you want to buy a confortable sport shoes for your kid.
Looks fine will update my review after my daughter wear it
My daughter say it's like walking on a cloud
My daughter is 7 and has been asking for 'walking on air shoes' for quite a while. These were a decent price and she LOVES them. They get a 4 star rating because the toes are showing wear after just a couple days. I hope they still look good for school in the fall.
My daughter loves these
The tread wore out in 6 months but with my active daughter wearing them. Great show otherwise!
These are too cute! My 6 year old daughter loves them she says she feels like she's &#34;walking on a cloud&#34;
I have been a Skechers shoe wearer for YEARS, however I just got these for my daughter and they lasted a couple of months before the toe seems started to rip out. Everything on the shoe is great and she loved the feel and they have excellent traction but they are all ripped out at the tow.
These seem to run on the smaller side I would size up if your child will be wearing them<br />For a while
I love it
My daughter was an 8 in Nike brand shoes that were getting small. I purchased a 9, but had to return them for a 10. Otherwise, I love the shoes. Well made and very cute!
tumbs up
Excellent!!!
This was a gift for a little girl and she has beenwearing these every day. She lives the shoes!
my daughter loves it very much and likes to wear it all days
My daughter loves wearing these and how cushy the inside is!
Love these shoes
i bought these for my daughter and she loves them. They fit as expected and and very comfortable for her. She loves the bright pink color.
Very comfortable and good support. My daughter loves them!
I bought these for my 8-yr old daughter after she complained of painful cheap gym shoes that were easy to fall apart.  They are a little more expensive for a child (their feet grow so fast!) but well worth it.  She loves them and wears them all the time!  They fit true to size and the soft soles are really comfortable.
My daughter loves these shoes!!
Excellent
Nice sneakers, my 4 year-old daughter loves them. My daughter is a size 8, but after reading the reviews I bought her a size 9 for these specific sneakers and they fit perfectly fine. I suggest purchasing one full size larger than you think you need.
Daughter loves them
Pleased<br />swwseeedess
My daughter saw the commercial for these & wanted a pair.  The first 2 weeks, she loved them.  However the &#34;air pockets&#34; in the sole didn't last longer than those first 2 weeks.  I think these shoes are probably better suited for the kiddos that are more dainty and delicate.  They just didn't hold up for my daughter, who is more of the rough-n-tumble type.  Also, the velcro strap wore out quickly as well.
Shoes fit nice and are comfortable for my daughter. Easy for her to get on by herself. Have held up good since she wears them almost everyday to school.
Great shoes. My 4 year old daughter loves them.
They look good.
My daughter go to school with those tennis shoes and like very much!  She run and play all the time!!!
Cute but too small. Definitely buy at least a size up.
My 5 year old daughter was very happy with these shoes! She is very sensitive to how shoes fit her feet. These fit great and she can wear them all day long!
Grand-daughter really likes the memory foam in the Skech Air Sneaker.  The other kids want them.
Daughter loves them. Says they are the best ever. Fit just as foot measures. Other child has narrow feet and cannot wear this brand.
Daughter is perfectly happy with these sneakers!
My daughter loves these shoes. I then saw that they got the memory foam with the Twinkle Toes. Great product and brand.
My daughter loves these - she can independently put them on and take them off, and she loves the bottom clear soles.
The shoes fit perfectly. Easy on/ easy off. They are extremely comfortable according to my daughter and she loves the pink/lavender color combination. Highly recommended!
Purchased for 9 year old granddaughter who wished to wear trampolines on her feet.  She has them, she loves them and she insists they make her jump higher.  I'd call that perfect.
The bottom bubbles began popping after a month.  Not being the every day shoe, I expected them to last a lot longer than they did.  Besides the deflation, the velcro fell apart and the shoe laces snapped.  For the price, I expected MUCH more.
My 4yo's favorite shoes. Great traction on almost every surface type, added noticeable stability to her strides when hiking or clambering around over rocks or when at the play park!
Little one loves them!
Bought for my 4.5 yo daughter. She saw the commercial and wouldn't stop talking about them She believes she just MUCH higher with them..Yay!!
My daughter loves these sneakers! They are comfortable and fun and she said it is like waking on springs. She loves them and I am happy with my purchase. With that being said, make sure you measure your child's feet and compare to Skechers size guide - I find that they are not quite the same as other brands so double check your measurements before ordering and you should be fine.
These shoes are fantastic and I buy them for my daughter time and time again.
We bought her a 1 1/2 because a couple of months ago she was sized at a 1, they fit great, with a little room to grow into.
The fit was too tight.
Very comfortable!!!!!
Love the Kids Skechers!!
Granddaughter loves these sneakers so much that she has almost worn the bottom out on them
Not fit, its too large for my 7 uear old daughter.
My daughter loves it!
My 9 year old loves them. Comfy. Bit of a struggle to get on but that is with most new shoes.
My daughter loves these shoes.
MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES THEM!!!
2nd pair of these runners for my daughter (size bigger this time) She loves them. They're really comfortable and look great!
Just what my daughter wanted at a great price.
Miss Annie loves them
very pretty
These sneakers are so colorful, just what my 6 year old daughter likes! They are so comfortable she wants to run in them and wear them all the time (she's more of a crocs kind of gal). They fit perfectly and came with an extra pair of hot pink laces.
My daughters both have these. They are their go to shoes for pretty much any day. Super comfortable inside!
Seriously beyond cute!! My niece is so excited to go back to school in these shoes! I would definitely encourage anyone to purchase this fun shoe! My only concern with the shoes would be the soles of the shoe. It has hollow pockets and I'm not too sure how long they might last before an active kid would wear holes in them.
I usually love Skechers but was disappointed with these. After one month, the sole started to come unglued. Also, any little scuffs are very visible. They scuff very easily.
I bought these for my daughter's birthday and she loves them. She especially loves the bright colors. She said it is like walking on pillows. Couldn't get her to take them off!  The fit was perfect.
Great shoes!
Great shoes and very comfortable!
i love them i am on my feet 8 hours a day and the air support iin them is wonderful
The shoes are absolutely high quality.  My granddaughter loves how comfortable they are, she said she feels like she's walking on air.  Because I had read the reviews before I purchased them, I actually ordered 2 pairs.  My granddaughter wears a size 1.  The reviews said that they run small so I ordered a size 1.5 and a size 2.  The size 2 actually fit her better and I am returning the size 1.5.
Fits as expected
My granddaughter loves it very much.
A++ Seller! Fast shipping and product just as pictured! Adorable shoes!
Great shoes for my 8 year old daughter
Love them
well, everything came in excellent condition
my daughter loves them they're comfy!
Nice light running shoe, always buy my daughter a new pair every year, only because last ones dont fit and still always have life left in them.
Excellent too beautiful<br />fast Shipping
Daughter loves these shoes. Fits as expected; says gel makes her feet feel &#34;alive.&#34; Would recommend.
Daughter was excited that she had two sets of laces, which she could change out depending on her mood.
My daughter Jacky is very happy! Very good quality...and I love the foam..
Actually bought these for myself (I have small feet). They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn and what an awesome price! I will be ordering another back up pair for when I wear these out!
good
I sent for 2 pairs of Kids Sketchers. They always fit so nice and comfy. The suede boot were real narrow at the regular size I get. When these Kids Flyaway Sneakers came I wondered had the sizes changed.But when they were put on they were PERFECT! And comfy as normal. A lot of shoes hurt. These Kids Sketchers Air Flyaway Sneakers are wonderful. And it lets you know there are good shoes out there for the kids to wear too.
Nice
Excellent!  They made my daughter's birthday a success!:)
This is a gift for my grandaughter, for the moment I can not confirm if the requested size is correct based on the indicators of page
Perfect except laces do not stayed tied. My child wanted these shoes and after searching several stores I ordered online. The shoes arrived in new condition, and we are using the multicolored purple/pink laces as opposed to the solid spare pair that arrived with the shoes.<br />The shoelaces constantly come untied, which has never been an issue for us in any other sneaker. My child won't even wear them to school because of the constant need for shoelace tying and the trip factor when they come undone. Going to try some different laces and see if that solves the problem.
Purchased for a six year old who says they are like walking on air.
My daughter said they were very comfortable. Order a size bigger than she normally wears so she can have them for a while and they weren't too big...just enough room to transition to the next growth spurt 
Great shoes for active big kids
I purchased these for my granddaughter who says her feet and legs always hurt her.  As soon as she put them on she was dancing around and telling me how good they feel on her feet.  She loves them and wears them everyday and says her feet don't hurt anymore.
granddaughter loves them
My daughter loves her shoes she says they are very comfortable; she is very picky about shoes, she is 8.
My daughter loves them thinking of buying them for myself.
excelente
Great shoe.  My daughter wears them almost daily and finds them to be super comfortable.
Seems like great shoes. My daughter has worn them every day since she got them.
The Doughter who hates Sneakers love these Sneakers. Worth the money.
My daughter likes these shoes
Great shoes!
my daughter loves these and she is super picky about her shoes!<br />They are comfortable and stay on well when she runs.
It's what I expected very good product
When my daughter had chosen this color I was a bit hesitant but when it arrived it looked great! Not as bubble gum pink as I thought it would be. She said it's really comfortable. I'd buy it again.
So comfy! I've had feet pain when wearing all types of shoes, even &#34;special&#34; athletic shoes that were supposedly customized for me. These how ever are the best!
Good
excellent very good and nice
I bought these for my daughter and they immediately became her favorite pair of shoes. They fit great, and have held up through months of use.
The width of shoe is a bit snugged but the length is as expected for my 6 year old.  She wore it for a month and went back to her boots instead.
bought these for my daughter, she loves them
My daughter loves her new shoes
My seven year old daughter loved them.
Bought these for my nieces birthday and she loved them! She said she felt like she was walking on clouds. Also added the gift wrap option and she was so thrilled that it came wrapped and just loved the bow!
My daughter LOVES these shoes!
My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves her new shoes. Very cute. Happy with my purchase
Initially my elementary daughter loved these. These are the only shoes she's ever had that made her feet stinky. Unfortunately, the material transfers odors. We sprayed them with shoe spray, then started putting them in the wash machine and ended up throwing them out after a couple of months.
These are cute and the correct size, but the heel tends to slip as you walk, causing rubbing and a blister.  had to have my grand daughter put on footies to make the shoe fit better, otherwise, she loves them and wants to sleep in them...thanks!
My child is very picky when it comes to shoes and I have finally found a pair that she loves!  I will be purchasing these again!!
Like the shoes, but a little too wide for my foot. So I have to wear thick sicks
So glad I can wear kid's sizes, they're a whole lot cheaper!
These are the first shoes my daughter hasn't complained about wearing. She is very particular about comfort, so I want to love them, but they were pricey, and after only two weeks and wearing them just a few times, they smell TERRIBLE. She has not had this issue with other shoes. I have washed them several times and dried them in the sun for 15 hours. I even bought active charcoal inserts to neutralize the odor, but they still smell too bad to wear. I feel like I completely wasted my money. They are such cute shoes...even cuter than they look online, but the smelliness is horrible. They didn't get wet or anything. They were just worn while out-and-about. Soooo disappointing.
Love these and so do my daughters. They do run a little big so I would recommend getting a half size smaller then your child typically wears.
These shoes fit great.  I recently discovered that I can wear a size 5 in Big Kids.  They seem to fit me better than women's size 7 as they are wider in the toe area while the heel is a regular fit.  So cute and so comfortable, like walking on a cloud.  Love, love, love them.
Awasome! My granddaughter says she is walking on clouds. A little pricey though but I checked everywhere and there is no better price whatsoever.
These shoes are very brightly colored, and look even better than in the photo. The fit was true to size for my daughter, but they were a little more narrow than some of the Skecher slip on shoes. The memory foam is comfortable, but can make your feet hot. (I purchased hers at JCP for $59).
My 5 year old loves these. Fit true to size, very comfortable she tells me.
Shoes are so cute!  My daughter says they are comfy too!
My daughter loves them so far.
Good shoes!
Great shoes.  My 6 year old loves them.  They come with 2 pairs of laces, which is always helpful.  Seem to be comfortable on her all day long.  Loves wearing them and they really stand out in a crowd!
She loves them.
Love them
Perfect fit, light weight, and arrived soon
Excelente producto
Really comfy. My wife loves them. Yes...my wife wears girls size 4 shoes.
Well worth your money, if your child has a hard time finding comfortable sneakers.
I ordered these for my daughter, as she needed a pair of white athletic shoes for PE days at school.  She can be pretty picky about how shoes fit, so I was hesitant to order something online without having her try it on first.  But, these shoes proved to be totally worth the risk!  She is thrilled with how comfy these sneakers are (thanks, Memory Foam footbed!).  We were both impressed with how lightweight the shoes were, as well....the style looks like it might be a little clunky or heavy, but it is an incredibly lightweight shoe.  I can't speak to how well they will hold up over the long-term, as she's only had them a few weeks.  And, they were a little bit pricier than what I would have liked to have paid.  However, the shoes meet her school's dress code requirement and she's completely happy with her new kicks.  So, overall, I think these sneakers were a worthwhile purchase.
Love the shoes but they just didn't work out.  My daughter is nine a wore a size 2 in Skechers last year so I bought her a size 4 this year to give her room to grow and last all year.  The shoe fit just as I wanted length wise but was too tight and uncomfortable around her foot.  I don't know if this had anything to do with the memory foam insole or not.  Sadly I had to send them back for a refund.
My daughter loves these shoes. She sad they are very comfortable!
OMG!! My daughter loved her new sneakers! The colors are great and they fit her comfortably. She has flat feet so the arch in the shoe helps her tremendously. She has not complained once about her feet hurting as she runs and plays all day with zero pain.
These are just perfect for my daughter.  We looked in the store and a 2 was too little and the 3 was too big-No local stores had a 2.5 .Thank you Amazon.  Great fit and they are just perfect for her.  She wears them everyday.
Memory foam makes the shoe very comfortable. This is for my six-year-old daughter, she really enjoys the memory foam shoe. It is a soft material that is porous but overall good shoe
Just perfect
Look amazing and fit as expected
These shoes were purchased for my 8 year old daughter. She has high arches and complains about foot pain if she wears anything besides skechers. She has these shoes in black as well as white for school. They are her absolute favorites. She can wear them all day without any foot pain. They are also very durable. Great value for my hard earned money.
My daughter loves these shoes. She said it feels like you are walking on clouds!
Love them!!
Cute shoes for my daughter.  My daughter loves Sketchers.
The shoe I received was the correct size and is a Sketchers sneaker, however, it's not the shoe that's shown.  I've attached a picture of what I actually received.  Luckily, my daughter loves the sneakers and thinks they're awesome, so I don't have to worry about returning anything!  I'm docking a star only because I didn't receive what I ordered.  I just got lucky that she wasn't upset about it.
Perfect fit!!  My daughter loves them and I love that they match just about anything and everything!!
My daughter is thrilled with these shoes. The best part is the memory foam inserts!
My daughter loves them. Only problem is the mesh will rip easily on rough surfaces, such as concrete.
Super cute!
Excellent
Daughter loves them.
the description said it was a medium width but they are pretty narrow. I needed a wide fit.
Thank you , its graet
I ordered these shoes for my daughter for back to school and they fit perfectly....thanks
My grand daughter loves these shoes.
My niece says these shoes are very comfortable and she loves the look of them.
Love them
gift for grandaughter
Got these for my daughter as part of her school uniform.  She loves them and says the feel great.
We loved this sneakers, they are more beautiful in person, Im very glad I got these for my daugther.
My daughter loves these shoes. They are lovely and comfortable.
My daughter loves these shoes!  The memory foam is super comfortable and the colors are awesome!
Daughter LOVES them!!!!!
fit perfect-my granddaughter wears them all day.  thanks
Needed to exchange for a slightly larger size.  Daughter loved them and said they were VERY comfortable and squishy inside.
Even cuter in person and very comfortable!
My daughter loves them and says they are so comfortable. She really likes showing them off and running in them. They offer great support with a flash of style and she is very happy with them ! Good shoe for the cost..
Sneakers were exactly what I needed for a 6 y/o niece. The rainbow colors match any color outfit. Niece reports that shoes are very comfortable. Plus good price.<br /><br />5 Stars
I ordered these from the States for delivery to the UK. The trainers arrived very soon after my order. Well packaged. Very comfortable. Good fit. I especially love the memory foam!
My daughter loves these.  They match with just about everything.
Eh
My 12 year old daughter loves these!
Really cute shoes. Bought them for my 10 yr old daughter.  She loved them and  said they were really comfortable for the first week or so but now she won't even wear them.  After just  a couple of weeks the fabric on the insole has stretched and the wrinkles under her feet are so  uncomfortable that she will not wear them at all.
ðŸ˜
Upon reading reviews, I decided to order a 1/2 size bigger than what my daughter currently wearing. They fit just right with a little room for growth.
My daughter loves them!  The memory foam insoles are wonderful on the feet!
Bought them for my 7 soon to be eight year old she loved them! She wore them one time and the pink paint around the heels came off.
For my daughter. She loves them! Success!!
These shoes are really comfortable. I bought these for my 8 yr old daughter.
My daughter loves these sneakers!
Keep purchasing this shoe as granddaughter ages. She loves them!
Love
My daughter LOVES these shoes!  For the first week she said they were like walking on clouds.  We got a pair for her brother eventually too.
My daughter loves them. She says they are very comfortable. I like the gray so dirt doesn't show so much.
Great product.
love them so comfy
Great shoe fast shipping
They fit perfect
Shoes are great on an active 7 year old feet. They have held well.
good shoes
Ordered te size I thought my daughter was but they were a size to small. Exchanged for the correct size and she is happy with them
I liked it.
These shoes arrived and were absolutely adorable for my 6 year old.  After the first wear, the pink paint that rings around the shoe was almost completely worn off.  The fabric on the toe also showed signs of wear day one, with small tears in the fabric.  She only wore them to school, so no out of the ordinary activities while wearing.  All in all, very cute but poor quality upper.
I would give these 5 stars but the pink paint around the bottom came off too easily and because they are knitted material, the toe is a bit torn up now. My daughter has worn these maybe 10 times but she does goof around a lot on the pavement. I have them for myself in adult size and I absolutely love them and get compliments on them all the time so I got her a matching pair. She also loved them but shes rough on her shoes. These are not made for rough wear. I don't recommend them for outdoor play.
My daughter loves them!
Had to return them.  My daughter normally wears a size 13 and I thought that by getting a 13.5 I was getting to stretch out my dollar spent.  But as soon as my daughter tried them on, she made it clear they were too tight.  She could not wear them at all.  So, it's a great shoe but runs small.  We purchased a size 1 and she is very happy with them.
geat shoes - walking on clouds!!
My kindergartener daughter wears this pair everyday to school.  Provides good support and cushion, feels durable too. We love it.
Purchased these shoes for my daughter, she absolutely loves them. They fit true to size. She said they are the most comfortable shoes she's worn!
I get comments on my colorful shoes everywhere I wear them.
Bought these shoes at the same time as another Sketchers pair without the memory foam and my daughter hasn't taken these off!  She said it's like walking on pillows
Purchased for my 9 yr old neice....she loves them!! She said they are very comfortable and they make her run faster and jump higher!! LOL Good product, well made, so cute!!
My daughter loves these shoes....I purchased them for her after having the adult version myself. If they are as comfy as mine are...so will continue to be a happy camper.
My daughter loves them.  She has had them on since we received them a week ago.
My daughter loves her new shoes!  The memory foam inside is so comfy!  Awesome!
Great
My daughter loves these shoes.  The foam foot beds are her favorite.  She says they are very bouncy.  (whether that is good or bad is debatable).  The colors look like they do online.  My only complaint would be the different pricing for different sizes.
My daughter loves them
This is the 3rd pair of skechers that I have brought for my daughter and see loves them, they atre a great fit, light to wear and she had said very comfortable.  Also great value for money
These shoes are really cute and were very comfortable, however after a week of wearing them the insole got worn. My daughter said they lost their cushion.
My daughter loves them.  She 7 and said it is like walking on clouds
fit as expectedï¼
Great shoes! Better than I had expected!
Very cute. Fit as expected. Good quality.
Perfect fit and brand new! Fast shipping as well!! Great prices! A+++++
Love the feel ordered a smaller size.  Love them. May order more in a different color
The shoes are somewhat large because I bought them bigger than the actual size needed.  These are for my daughter and she loves them and said that they're comfortable.  I would buy them again :-)
My daughter loves these shoes, especially the memory foam insole. And the price was much better than I found anywhere else.
My 7 years old daughter loves it, perfect fit, she say that they are comfortable and really softs, she wear them everyday for school, her favorite.
My daughters favorite pair of shoes
My Granddaughter LOVES these shoes.  Not only are they colorful and pretty but she says &#34;I can run like the wind&#34;!
I love this shoes it's very comfortable
For my daughter and she says she loves them; in her words &#34; I feel like I am walking on pillows&#34;
Love these shoes very colorful!
These are so cute.  My daughter loved them and said they feel like walking on a cloud.
Thank you
Very comfortable although the memory foam does get hot.
Perfect shoe, awesome price!
These are my daughters favorite.
Cute shoes, but WAY too small. My daughter wears a 3 in this brand (we bought another pair - Sketcher Sparkle Toes - the same day we ordered these), so we were surprised and disappointed when they didn't fit. Also, I can't find this in a 4; that's disappointing as well. As small as these were, I really don't think a 3.5 would work either. =/
my daughter loves the style of the shoe.  She says it's a bit tight in the arch - too narrow.  And she does not have wide feet at all.  Very narrow actually.
My Granddaughter loves these shoes. She said they are very comfortable.
My step daughter loves these !
My 9 year old love these shoes. The printable chart helped me order the perfect size. She says they fit well and are very comfortable.
My girl loves them. They are so comfortable and the fit is great.
Perfect Shoe for my 5 year old at the time.
I bought these for my daughter. She loves them. fast shipping!!
Really nice shoe my daughter loves them . Memory foam insoles.
These are great! Super cute. My daughter loves them. Seem to comfy. I would buy again or another color.
nice and good price
my daughter loves them.  no complaints!
Awful! Cheap painted on plastic on the sides that was sticky and had fuzz stuck all over it. Literally had paint drips on the side. Not up to normal Skechers standard at all. Returned them.
I purchased these for my daughter less than two months ago and the fabric gave away, by her toes. They were cute and comfortable but they just don't last.
Size chat that is not true. SIZE CHAT 5.5US=23.5cm,in  fact, the shoe's size is 5.5US=24cm.
My daughter loves these shoes! Perfect fit and they're in her favorite colors!!
Daughter likes how soft and comfy it is, just the yellow tip gets dirty easy.
Great looking shoes for my daughters sports days
Very good. My daughter is very happy.
The quality of the shoes I got are poor. After one day's normal wearing, the golden yellow surface cover wear out. And shoe glue lie at some unexpected place such as the surface.
Even better than expected. Beautiful
These are so adorable, and comfortable for my daughter, but they are already ripping at the toes where the white fabric meets the sole.
Really cool shoes!!!! Cute and comfortable!  My daughter refuses to take them off!
My girl Lovesthe shoes! Very lights and true to size!
My daughter loves these shoes! She says they are very comfortable.
Great shoes. Fit really well and nice cushion.
These shoes look cute but the quality is terrible. The fabric by the toes started to rip apart a couple of weeks after purchasing and she didn't even wear these shoes daily!! Very disappointed.
These were beautiful and fit perfect!
Very happy with product. shipping was fast
She loves them a lot.
Skechers are my go to shoe for my 8 year old daughter. They always fit her well.
These shoes are great!  I ordered them for my daughter for our trip to Chicago because we were going to be doing lots of walking.  They fit great and were really comfortable.  She loves them!
My 6 year old daughter loves these shoes! She's wore twinkle toes for the last year or so and wanted to try the memory foam skechers and LOVES them. Will wear them all day with no complaints. She says she can't help running when she puts them on!
Super comfortable.  My girls love them!
Great shoes!  Fit as expected.
Almost too small! But cute and lightweight and came on time!
Good
perfectos
Very good!
My daughter loves these shoes. Comfortable and love the style.
Awesome tennis shoes.  Daughter loves!
My child loves these shoes. Thanks
Wore all day x 3 days at amusement parks and feet never bothered her.  Definitely worth the purchase!
My niece loves these shoes!
My daughter loves these shoes.
Excellent job
My daughter 10 years old loves this shoes.
Good.....
My daughter LOVES these shoes...not only the design but the super comfy memory foam.  We love Sketchers and these shoes do not disappoint.
Exactly as shown and described! Fit perfectly! She loves them!!
My daughter and me love this shoe. It's comfortable, light and beautiful
I got these dor my 4yr old daughter and she absolutely loves them.they fit perfectly.its now her favorite shoe.no laces and very flexible lightweight shoe.
Love Love Love these shoes. My daughter loves that there is memory foam in the soles, so it helps her wear them longer. They are very light weight and so cute..
Perfect fit as expected. Comfortable
Fit was as expected and the shoes seem really comfortable. My daughter doesn't want to wear her other shoes now. They did not leave anyou rub marks even in the first days of breaking them in.
This is a very comfortable shoe but if your kids have any issue with uneven wear then this is diffenately not a good choice.<br />The sole of this shoe is a soft foam and gets easily compressed under compression!<br />So if you apply pressure to one side then ...<br />I had to through out the shoes after only few weeks
Is there any other rating you can give Skechers?!  My whole family is a Skechers family and we love them.
These shoes are very lightweight and comfortable and very cute.  I bought them for my daughter who I have a very<br />hard time finding shoes that fit.  These were perfect and she loves them.  She has worn them every day since they<br />arrived.
Fits true to size, my daughter is 8yrs old and a size 2.5 and I purchase a 2.5. She loves that she can just slip her feet in and out especially after she gets out of gymnastics practice. Great buy super fast!
Sketchers came and fit and looked like I ordered online.
Arrived on time, exactly as described.
Awesome shoes for a child.  Can be used for recess/PE and are very stylish for everyday wear.  I highly recommend!!!
Absolutely amazing shoes. The most comfortable Ive ever put on.
The shoes fit my daughter perfectly!  They are of great quality, they arrived on time, and they are very stylish!
My 4 year old daughter loves these shoes and can wear them all day and be comfortable. She loves the softness (memory foam) on the inside. We can go on walks, she can play and ride her bike in these with comfort! Cute, comfortable and stylish!
My daughter love this shoes!!
Our Granddaughter loved them.
Wow very impressed with this shoe. Much more stylish than it appears on the pic. Great fit for my 5-year old daughter. Very comfy. She loves the shoes!
I bought this to go to Disney last year and my daughter didn't complaint at all about her feet hurting and trust me we were all day on our feet.
Ordered for my daughter and she loves them.
Perfect fit easy transaction.
My daughter loves these shoes! She's says they're very comfortable
Nice shoe, runs a tad small
Daughter loves. Bottom seems to be wearing quickly but I'm sure she'll grow out of them before they are totally worn out.
It's like walking on air. So comfortable and they fit well.
My daughter loves them. They are fancy yet practical.
My daughter loves shoes. She said it is so comfortable. My loves the softness and squishiness of this shoes an they don't hurt. I am happy my baby loves these shoes. I will definitely order these shoes again.
I bought them in my daughters size at the time and they were way to big but they were very cute so we kept them for almost a year until she was able to fit into them.
EXCELENTE
great shoes and very fast shipping!
It looks very good,my baby like it very much.
Good shoes
When the USA size says toddler size 5 you expect it to be a toddler size and not infant size.
My Grandson loves them and never complained about them hurting.
The kid loved the lights, and we loved being able to turn them off when we are at an event. After we put them in the wash we realized you can't do that. They do not work any longer.
Our baby loves them !
My daughter's favorite now! The twinkling toes make these especially cute! She wears them all the time and they're barely worn! They are true to size and shipped on time! I'd recommend these for anyone's daughter!
Shoes are very cute and my 2-year old loves them, however as another reviewer stated they are EXTREMELY SLIPPERY and can be dangerous!! We have hardwood floors and when she puts these on she slides all over the place and constantly falls down. This is even after my husband and I vigorously rubbed the bottoms on rough concrete to attempt to roughen them up, which made no difference at all. They seem ok on concrete, but I worry how they will be changing surfaces, like from a concrete pool area to a tiled hotel lobby. I may return them or just keep them for outdoor use only. Very disappointed.
My Granddaughter loves them!  So excited!!!!
My 3 year old loves that they light up.
My daughter loves these
Excellent thank you very much
Nice shoe, my son likes them.  They were a little hard to get on at first, but loosened up.  Would have been nice if they had sold them in my son's size of 2, but the 3 is ok.
These shoes are beautiful. My daughter loves them. Light weight and we added a little insole because she has flat feet. Will order again.
My daughter loves all skechers, and these are adorable.
Our 7 and 8 year olds love their new shoes!<br />They love that they are very lightweight, and that the sparkles are in the threads,<br />and won't fall off!
These are so much cuter in person! In the picture it's not as noticeable how glittery and sparkly these are. Just perfect for my 9 year old!
She loved them!
Love love love the shoes! I had to return them for a bigger size but that was my fault. My daughter needs them for school uniform and they look great and must be sooo comfortable with the memory foam!
Great sneakers for my grandson, he just loved them
Fit just right arrived on time. Thanks.
My kid loves his sneakers. He said it was like walking on clouds !
We weren't able to find them at any local shoe store so we decided to to try online purchase. They were perfect!! Thank you.
My kids love these shoes. We frequently visit Universal Studios and Disney and the kids would complain about their feet hurting after a few hours. These shoes are very comfortable and perfect for those long days at the amusement parks. I purchased a pair for myself as well.
Very comfortable
excelente
Love the look, arrived on time. My child was happy to receive a little booklet with these pair. Thanks! Size was as expected.
I love these shoes but they started falling apart about 3 weeks after he got them.
My 11 year old son loves the fit, comfort and style of these sneakers :-)
everything as expected
A little narrow. Hoping they stretch. Cute. Good quality.
My son loves them! He said they're very light and he likes the way they look! Fit is perfect.
My picky son likes this shoe. He has flat feet and this feels good on his feet.
My daughter loves them. Exactly as I expected.
Awesome, cute, comfortable, easy to put on shoes. There isn't much more to say than that. I really like the soft insole, and my toddler actually keeps these on for more than 5 minutes, which is a miracle!
Daughter loves it. Looks comfortable
Very durable and great that you can throw them in the washer and they come clean. Aren't quite as bright after a few washings, but that is to be expected. They are very comfortable and our 3 yr old daughter loves wearing them.
Light weight pretty and fashionable
This is the second pair of Sketchers for our youngest (she outgrew the other pair) and the total of our 4th pair of Sketchers for our kids.  I definitely look for Sketchers first before any other brand as we have been very pleased with comfort, longevity and washability.
Very lightweight but still structured with support, comfy, and easily washable at a reasonable price point. They run true-to-size, almost exactly like her Saucony ones. I much prefer them to her last pair of Stride-Rites.
These just arrived and I love them!!! Let me start by saying what lovely colors are in this shoe. It's vibrant and adorable!! Secondly, the memory foam inside of it is pretty thick which is a plus for comfort. Here's where I was beginning to get a little concerned... my daughter has always worn a wide in sneakers. I decided to give these shoes a try, knowing that they did not come in a wide. They fit!!! It's a tight fit with a thinner sock. I'm very pleased. I'll update this review after she's worn them in a bit, but so far so good.
Very cute and my toddler loves them
Great fit, not very easy to clean.
I love this shoe for my 2 year old!  It's pefect for playground play - very durable and easily washable!  The Memory Foam cushioned comfort insole is why I bought these but it makes the shoe tight so we returned and got the next size up.  I'm giving 5 stars just wanted to note the size for future buyers!  Amazon is wonderful as they make it SO easy to exchange!
very good
Sneaker smaller than size it says. Toddler size 6 didn't fit size 5 1/2 shoe size.
SO CUTE AND FEEL REALLY COMFY WHEN I PUSH ON THE INSOLE.  THE SHOES ARE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS ONLY 1-1/2 YRS OLD, SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HER.  I KNOW MY SKECHERS ARE EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE AND I HAVE NEUROPATHY, SO THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.  HERS FEEL EVEN MORE CUSHIONY THAN MINE.  SHE HAS NOT COMPLAINED.
Have sent back.  Just want to swap out for a larger size.  Shoes look great though.
My little one loves them, very comfortable. But the color is more hot pink than pink in the picture
it is so cute and looks beautifulï¼Œbut i do not know why my daughter do not like to wear them
Love'em and bought 3 pairs!
Fantastic shoes that fits my toddlers feet perfect! Didn't know until we got them, but they have some sort of memory like foam inside of them. Made my other daughter jealous and now she wants a pair!
So cute and comfy! Love the memory foam.
Bought for my daughter. She is enjoying it
My girl love this shoes
my little girl loves it very much
Great!!!
Love these!!
It was a birthday gift for my niece and her mom loved it.  It's lighter than expected, so was perfect for the summer.
I'm giving this 5 stars, as it's a great sneaker, However, I had to return, as my daughter's feet are extra, extra wide, and these did not fit. I had no idea her feet were so wide, I'm having such a heard time finding sneaker to fit her. I almost kept these for her young sister, I think they are such a great sneaker. I love, love the colors.
Daughter needed them for preschool she needed velcro she can put them on herself
Perfect !!
This is the second pair I bought for my daughter. She absolutely loves them. She can play and run all day in this shoes. They also are very durable. We haven't had to replace them until they no longer fit. Attached is a photo after 3 months of everyday use from my 2 year old.
Ä° like it
My 4-yr old daughter loves these shoes. She told her teacher that they were very comfortable.
Love this shoes
Great pair of shoes. Both kiddo and I are happy.
Excellent...!!!
We just got these shoes today and my daughter loves them! But if you wanna purchase this shoe make sure you order one size bigger then what your kiddos wear! My daughter is 3 years old and wears a size 8, I red a couple reviews about these shoes being to small so I ordered a size 9 for her! I am so glad that I did because the shoe fits just right! If I would of ordered what she wears in any other shoe they would of been to small and I would of had to send them back!
My kids both love Skechers!  Very comfy.
They seemed a little tight but as she uses them their fitting perfect!!  I would actually like to order more!!!
love skechers and how comfortable they are... they are a tiny big on my 5yr old, but that was somewhat expected.
granddaughter says they hurt her feet, will not wear them,
Returned
I ordered a half size larger than normal and these shoes are a little bit narrow and slightly hard to get on.  Don't think they'll last long.  I'll probably replace them soon.
These are cute shoes, but are small. I ordered the next size that I could (8.5) and plan on returning the size 7.
excelente
A+
Easy to put on and to take off. Extremely comfortable and unbeatable price on amazon!
My daughter had been having leg pain wearing other tennis shoe brands and once I bought these my daughter has not had any pain. I am very pleased and happy this shoe exists. Thank you Skechers!
My baby love it
Love them
Great shoes for the kid, well made and sturdy
3 weeks of school use and still look brand new. my son has a fat foot, and out of the 2 pair of sketchers we bought...same size, different lace system he says he likes this one best because he can adjust the straps to make it comfortable on his foot. He complained about the pair we bought that have a stretchy lace and then Velcro at the top as being too tight on his foot, so if your little guy has big and wide foot, go for this kind.
Very good! Wear appropriate comfortable! The price also is very favourable. Amazon is great!
why on earth would anybody buy a no name brand when you can buy Nike for the same price....
Arrived quickly perfect for school for my 13 year old
Good price no shipping or tax. What a deal.
Excellents, supportive, comfortable shoes.
These shoes are not the true size.  At least a whole size too big.  Strange since the last pair of skechers were right on.  I don't know about the quality because I'm returning them.
super  fast delivery.  Colors are exactly as shown, bright and fun.  Gave them to my 5 yr old grandson and he had to show me how much faster he could run.  Love that he doesn't have to tie the shoes since he as muscle dexterity issues.  Waiting to see how they last with rugged wear.
Great shoe for my 6 year old!  More durable than most other shoes we've tried and surprisingly light weight.  The &#34;Z Strap&#34; is convenient, easy, and sturdy.
A review
Very nice material...
My son really likes these shoes
excellent product
Solid price, my son loves them, probably a third less than major retailers.  You can't go wrong with these, and apparently Skechers are cool again???
Great deal my son loves 'em!!
NO
I WOULD NEVER BUY THESE SHOES AGAIN!!!!! My son wore them for one month (and not every day of that on month) and they already have a hole in them. And now, I can no longer return them since the return policy is only good for 30 days at Amazon. I may never buy children's shoes off of Amazon again. Had I purchased these at the Sketchers store I could have returned them for an exchange or my money back. Sketchers always last my son around 6 months. THIS WAS MONEY THROWN AWAY.
My 5-year-old loves these. He's been wearing them everyday for months and they're still holding up.
Good light weight shoes, exactly what I was looking for. Easy to put on for my 5 year old.
Very well made shoes. My son is 8, and very particular on his footwear. These even made him happy. The color combination is great, the fit superb. I already have the next size up for when he needs them.
My boyz love them and they fit perfectly!
Great shoe
Grandson loves this sneaker!
Son will actually wear these!
My son wears a size 12 in Stride Rite shoes, and typically a size 12 works for him in other brands, even other Skechers.  These seem to be a little big and slide off his heel.  They are doable, but will take a little time to properly fill them in.
Even with socks these things made stinky feet. Never had that issue with New Balance sneakers. Odor eaters helped minimize the smell.
Fit as expected..good product.
It was bigger than we expected, but he can wear later,,<br />Shoes are very light and it will be good for running.
Kids love them
Good shoe
Perfect shoes for my kindergartener's school uniform
Ok
Good product
Great shoe! Perfect fit!
My son is very happy with this product. He loves sketchers.
Looks as shown. Cute and durable
Very very nice ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Lightweight...durable. Excellent fit
My 8-year old son expressed how much he liked these shoes when he first got them. He especially likes that he doesn't have to mess with shoe laces. Easy slip on and off without having to mess with tangled shoe laces.
We love these shoes! They hold up so well and look great with uniform! All black and light weight! It's perfect! My son loves them so must I just ordered next two sizes up to make sure we have them through the school year! Great price and durable!
The pest brand for the children
Had to return it
excelente  gracias
My little man loves his new shoes
Excellent
fits very well. good product
These shoes are sturdy but real light. At first I didn't want to buy them because they looked like they would be heavy, but when I got it, they were delightfully light and fit my sons perfectly.
My son loves these sneakers. They're light and comfortable
looked great
Very confortablefor my kid
My son loves these shoes.
they are great shoes for active boys who are to lazy to tie laces
Perfect!!!!
Litte disappointed one light didn't work
Super cute shoes. Fit & shipped as expected. Great quality shoes as always from Sketchers. I order my daughter a new pair every time she outgrows the old ones.
Very comfy! They have some extra cushioning in these than normal. My daughter says its like walking on clouds;) We get new twinkle toes every fall and these don't disappoint! My girls LOVE light up shoes!
I absolutely love these shoes. They are adorable, and I wish they would have had shoes like this when I was a kid. They fit great and have a memory foam insole, so they are very comfortable.
Original photo didn't do the blue in these shoes justice!  Great pink/blue combo!
Love it!
Great shoes. My daughter love it.
Everything about these shoes are great.  They look good and my daughter likes them.  However, only one shoe lights up.  So it's defective, hence my 2 star review.  Otherwise, I would have given it 4-5 stars.
Very nice pair of shoes!
Really pretty shoes. My daughter loved them.
I love these shoes they fit so good
Shoes are adorable.  My granddaughter wears them and matches them up with her outfits.
these are the older style of this shoe...there is no way to turn off the lights, for school purposes, and there is no support in the foot-bed.
My daughter loved these shoes - but the lights did not work after a month and a half.  I am not sure if that is the normal amount of time or not.  But she liked them a lot!
Pricy but good looking pair of shoes.
Nice
This shoe is Super Cute!! They basically look the same way as they do on the internet, but just better in person.  When I received them, I was totally happy with this purchase.  My baby is styling & profiling!!
These look better when you get them than they do in the picture and I didn't think that was possible!! They are absolutely the cutest shoes I've ever seen from Sketchers and they look great!!! They hold up really well and my daughter is hard on shoes.
The right shoe lights up and left does not.
Great shoe 5 yrs old loved then
Love these shoes!
bought for a gift
Perfect
My daughter loved it!
They arrived quickly and fit as expected. Very happy all around
Very happy!
My daughter LOVES these. Talk about nostalgic!
I purchased these for my 5 year old daughter. She loves them. They are different and have a denim look to them. The buckle also just adds a little extra to the shoe which is great. Goes great with leggings. Very stylish!
Wonderful
Beautiful, fit as expected, definitely in love with them
My daughter wore these shoes for her first day of kindergarten. The fit and style of these shoes are great. Other moms asked me where I brought these shoes because I live in a small town and these shoes were not available for purchase. I want to order the dark navy because those would match her uniform better.
Love this shoe!!
My daughter love it
This pair of shoes fit true to size. I can't say enough about these shoes. When my daughter wore it to school for the first time, she received so many compliments from her schoolmates.<br />The shoes are very sturdy and the lights are so dazzling especially at night. I wish I had a pair when I was a kid!
my daughter loved them
My daughter loves these shoes. She is hard on shoes but so far no issues after 3 months.
Fits true to size; super cute and versatile. Zipper sticks a bit at first but a little wax did the trick.
excellent
My 5 year old loves these sneakers, comfortable padding around the ankle with Velcro and a fun zipper, can use the laces to teach her how to tie her shoes.  The toes light up easily, exactly what she wanted with a great blue color that sparkles!
Fit great
Super cute but could not get them to fit right. Behind the zipper is leopard print, which my kid really liked. The lights on top of the toe are way too bright for school.
Love these shoes. Work perfect for my daughter who wears leg braces! Have bought 3 pairs.
My daughter loves these. Perfect for learning to tie laces, as she can zip on/off when we're in a hurry. They are as obnoxious as any other twinkle toes, but she loves them and they are less pink than most of her shoes - so five stars
My daughter loves them. She doesn't complain to me so I assume the shoes are OK. In terms of arch support, not as good but maybe an extra insert could be put inside to provide a better support. I used to do it for other shoes as well.
My daughter loves this sneakers.  She would not take them off.
She loves the shoes, one tiny problem is that she has to wear high socks cause the fabric around the zipper rubs and leave her skin red and painful.
My daughter of 8 years old loves these shoes. She told me she has been getting lots of comments on them.
Bought for my granddaughter and she loves them
My 7 year old granddaughter loves them. The gold glitters & looks trendy & fun with all her casual clothes, from jeans to leggings to skirts & casual dresses. She has a very narrow foot so the high top is a great solution for that fit issue. Thrilled she loved 'em!
Love them!
These were great for my fashionista daughter
My one year old said LIGHTS!
Glitter parts began splitting almost immediately, which is a problem with all of these shoes.
exicting,very fit
Beautiful shoes, bright colors!! Look better than the picture. Very pleased, can't wait to give them to my daughter!!
Fit great and super cute!!! I didn't realize this but the shoes have a small button on them to turn the twinkle on and off!
Love these shoes
A little big but my daughter loves it
My daughter loves it very much. The Twinkler works well only for a month, then it is blind!
Very very cute shoes! My kiddo loves them!
So good...<br />My daughter likes..
My daughter loves Twinkle Toes but must be hard on them. The material wasn't able to stand up to her daily wear for very long. That won't deter us from buying again though- she just won't wear them to daycare.
Received them quickly.
I bought these for my granddaughter. Not sure about fit.
Cute and durable.
My little one had her heart set on a pair of twinkle toes. The first pair I ordered from kohls in a size 10 (she's a 9.5 or 10 depending on the brand) and the right shoe didn't light up. This was ok since they were really big. I returned those and ordered these as a replacement, but could only get them in a size 10. They are still a bit big, but nothing like the first pair. Both shoes light up easily, they are way cuter than the first pair, and she's thrilled!
Lov them
They were a little too big.
Cutest shoe ever!!!
My daughters favorite shoes ever.
Left shoe did not light up. Returned product. After reading the reviews, it sounds like the lights burn out quite quickly! I will not repurchase.
They are super cute but chunky for my little one to walk comfortably in :///
My 5yr-old daughter loves these shoes. This is her 2nd pair. Fits true to size and great quality. We always get lots of compliments.
This is the fourth pair of twinkle that we've bought our daughter. However, it's the first pair that doesn't seem to be holding up. She's had them for a week, today, and the rainbow tie-dye pattern on the side seems to be fading, the bow is tearing off of the strap, and the sparkles on the toes are losing their color. I know that she's three and can be a little hard on things but her purple twinkle toes she's had for over three months and they seem to be worn out less than these new ones.
My daughter LOVES these! They are still a bit too big for her but she wears them anyway. Couldn't figure out how to turn off the blinking lights. Seem pretty stiff but they are still pretty new.
My daughter loves these! The fit is as expected. They're a little bit for her but that's because I bought a size bigger so she can grow into them. She's 3 and she loves that she can put them on by herself and loves running around so they light up.
My daughter seen twinkle toes on a TV commercial. And, I ordered them for her as a birthday gift. But I know she'll love them!!!
I have never bought shoes online before, but have had difficulty finding my kids sizes in the store.  I am very pleased.  My order arrived on time and they fit my kids great.  My kids love their new shoes and fit is great also.  Update- I bought another pair, size 12, and they are a little big for my daughter.  But she will grow in to them.  These are her favorite shoes, so we make them work.
The lights only worked on 1 shoe. My granddaughter was very upset that they both did not light up.
My daughter wanted these after seeing the commercial and I decided that they would be a great back to school surprise! She loves them and wants to wear them all the time!
Adorable!
We had the sequined with hot pink bow before and the lasted for over 2 years lights and all. So far so good! We love our shoes and the light up beautifully!
Love them !!!
great
Really cute and my daughter loves them.  Her favorite back to school item!  They fit try to size and are easy for her to out on and off (she is 6).  The little bow on the side is darling.
These shoes are awesome! My daughter loves them, they are super cute. The bow is pretty and the lights are bright (so bright that it almost hurts your eyes, almost). They match with most of her clothes as she loves hot pink, and what 4 year old girl doesn't. I will buy these again for her little sister!
Perfect!
one shoe didnt light up on arrival Im trading them in for another pair, these are suuuuper cute and will be getting a pair for other nieces. Hope the next pair works if not they are suuuuuper cute anyway!!
My daughter loves them. Great price too!!!
She loves them!
My daughter loves these shoes so much! They go with everything and we constant compliments. She loves to tap them on the floor and show everyone how they light up. She plays in them all day every day and they have very little wear on them. Great shoes!
My 4 yr old absolutely loves these shoes!
Love these shoes !  They are easy on and easy off , important for a six year old . Would buy another in a different color .  Ordering and delivery was quick and painless , no long line !!
I bought these for my daughter for school and she loves them! Even cuter in person!
My child is extremely happy
Five star they are great and fit perfect and the girls loved them ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘ðŸ»
I want to return
I bought these for my 2 year old daughter and she loves them!
My daughter is so happy with her new sketchers. Very happy with this purchase.
Just the most fabulous shoe for an 18 month old, I am afraid she will bump into walls, though, as she is constantly watching them.
My daughter LOVES her twinkle toes!!! This style and color I'm particular is very cute! Will definitely buy another pair  again. They are also true to size. Your daughter will not be disappointed 8)
Adorable just bummed they are bigger than your average size 10 shoe
it's okay
Super cute shoes! Great for wider feet!
i think my kid needs size 8. Unfortunately i bought size 9 :(
These shoes were a little too big for my 17-month old granddaughter.  But, when she had them on, she was amazed and entertained by the little twinkle toe lights.  Plus, the shoe was more &#34;gold&#34; than the picture, which appears to be a more neutral gold-tone.  We may reorder in a smaller size and different color.
this is my favorite website to order the stuff
My toddler loves these shoes.  They sparkle, they shine, they light up, they are magical in her eyes!  The only negative is that the bow comes loose if you constantly use it as a grip to pull the strap.
I bought them a size bigger, but I can tell they would have fit perfectly if I didn't. We love them.
Granddaughter loves the lights.  They are easy for me to put on her and of course she can close them herself.
My two-year-old loves these shoes, and once she outgrew her pair, we ordered them in the larger size here on Amazon.
Very cute little sneakers but only one lights up.. our 2 year old doesn't really notice but a little dissapointing (we live out of the US so not worth the shipping to send them back)
My 4 years old got these for her birthday and loves them. They fit perfectly and are so cute! She gets compliments on them all the time
Super cute shoes, my daughter is very happy :)
baby love it!
The shoes are sturdy and get noticed everywhere we go. The Velcro closures work great. Good shoe for the price
They fit my daughter a bit big! And there was a small imperfection with them :(
Shoes are too big.
I purchased this shoes for my daughter as a Christmas gift 2 years ago. She loves wearing these because it is easy for her to put them on and remove them.  It gives her a sense of independence which benefits me too :-). Two years and she is using them.  They still look new up to now. Great buy. I will probably buy this again.
My daughter absolutely loves these shoes! She is rough on her shoes and they are still in great condition. Definitely worth the money!
Fantastic great fit came quite Quickly
Excellent
cute
The lights in the left shoe only worked when hit extremely hard. When my toddler is walking and running normally, only the right shoe lights up. Very disappointing.
My daughter loves these shoes, I ordered her actual size and they were a bit to big but she grow into them. Hated when she has to get rid of them, but we were able to find someone at a good cheap price.
These shoes are so pretty.<br /> Kids love this shoe.<br /> I want to buy more shoes.<br /> I highly recommend these shoes to the baby mama.<br /> The large size of the shoe.<br /> If you choose a good size would be a good choice.
good
Size down, these run a little large.
Best shoes for little kids. Good quality
We love these shoes. Fast shipping and brand new. Cheaper than Nordstrom rack! They fit great and are some of the most durable shoes we have. It's not worth it to pay a little less from Target and have the knock offs fall apart after just a few wears.
The light left toe doesnt turn on!! Not working!!!!
These shoes are cute and they have the all important flashing lights! However, with the lights being they exception, my 3 1/2 year old daughter doesn't like how they feel and will take them off at the first instance.<br /><br />She has an average width foot and they flop around a lot.<br /><br />I wouldn't purchase these again based on the fit for my daughter, however, would try the Sketcher Trainer style shoes that my oldest daughter had around the same age, as they were nice.
These are totally adorable in person. My daughter loves them and they twinkle brightly. She wears about a 11.5 and I bought an 11 because the reviews said they run large. I should've went with the 11.5. She said they're a little tight but they're wearable for now. My daughter is pretty rough on shoes but she's wore them to the park a handful of times and they're holding in there. For the price, they were a good deal. Highly recommend them
I purchased these for our daughter and she loves them.  She wants to sleep in them.  She loves purple and I was concerned as to how that would look as monitor's can change the true color, but these arrived looking great.  Very happy and my daugher is too.
My daughter really likes it
I love these pair so much!!. I bought it for my little girl over a year ago and she still use them!!!. She loves the lights and seems to be really comfortable. Will definitely recommend
Adorable! Soooo much cuter in person than the picture!! Bought them as a gift but my sister says they run just a tad big on my niece!
My daughter has gone through several pair of these as she has grown.  She has loved every pair.
the twins are enjoying the lights and ran around and around giggling
My 2.5 year old picked these out herself. She loves blue, so I am glad we found some cute ones.  These are super shiny, sparkly, and bright! I love that they are a dark color and don't show dirt easily. She wants to wear these everyday with everything.  She actually just came over and said, &#34;Mommy I really love those shoes.&#34;  She can totally put them on herself so that is a bonus!<br />I was under the impression that they are blue and red, but they are blue and bright pink.  That actually works well for us since most little girls clothes have some pink on them and it means these coordinate with many of her outfits.<br />I measured my daughters feet using the guide on Sketchers website and it said she was a 9 exactly.  These seem to be slightly large for her but they still work. She just has some growing room.  They are also a little wide on her even though her feet are a little wide to begin with (though not enough to merit getting a wide width shoe). But with the adjustable velcro I can get it tight enough on her foot so there is no slippage.
These are the cutest shoes. My granddaughter was running around with them before we had time to take off the tags!
Daughter loves them! They are really cute and made very well.
Very cute and sturdy. My 2 year old loves them!
My little one loved them, the package it self seemed a bit torn up, but the shoes it self were in perfect condition thanks!
Exactly what I expected and my little one loves them too.
They were a gift
These fit my daughter perfect! She loves how they light up! They are kind of wide which is perfect for my daughter who has chubby feet.
My daughter loves them. She ran around the house in the dark the first night she had them!
I ordered my granddaughters regular size and they were too big. They are in the closet for a later time. They are cute, just not sized as others the same size.
Big hit!
2 year old daughter loves them. The lights are red and blue and in a dark car, from the back seat, can make you pretty nervous lol.  Very bright and super cute though.
Gorgeous sneakers
Appreciate the item looking to do business again
Very cute!  My 3 year old loves them.
I have bought 4 pairs of Skechers twinkle shoes throughout years for my lovely daughter. They are all solid and good quality. The lights never run out before they became too small to wear. Too bad that they don't have similar style for boys because my son is so jealous of her big sister's shinning cool shoes.
My daugther love it, beautiful and Perfect she is 5 and her feet are small si a size 10 work Perfect
My daughter loves them. They kind of have a double purpose, as a shoe and as a toy.
Lovely shoe but small
It's beautiful and comfortable than I expected
I couldn't wait until my daughter's feet reached the smallest size in Twinkle Toes. These shoes are absolutely gorg, fun and cute for toddlers. They're age appropriate too. She loves seeing them light-up as I do watching her smile.
Adorable!
Adorable, fits a little bit big but my daughter absolutely loves them.
Good
3 yo loves them and they are easy for her to get by herself, win!
A gift for my grand daughter for her birthday. She loves these sneakers and finds them very comfortable.
My daughter hates these! They are made of satin inside so every time she walks they slip off. so bummed because they are so so cute!!
These are the most bling-y shoes I've ever seen. I actually stopped a mom in a store to ask where she got them - something I never do.  Our three year old granddaughter loves them.  They run big, so consider the next-smaller size.
Bought this as a gift for my niece's 5 year old daughter.  She loves it!
These are the only kind of shows we buy now.  She is 2 and 1/2 and already know what shoes she wants.  We only get her sketcher twinkle toes. She absolutely loves them.
Well it was purchased for a 3ry old. My daughter who is now8 still likes them..<br />I love it there cute and since my child is in daycare makes it easy for her to put them on.
My toddler wears an 11 in Stride Rite shoes but the 11 in these Sketchers ran a little big. The shoe falls off when she runs. I know she will grow into them, but I would have liked for them to fit now.
LOVED these for my daughter! The fit was perfect and is well made. Fun lights appear when she steps which she loves. I will be buyingthis again in different colors!
These were so cute, my niece who was visiting and happens to be my daughter's size had to have a pair as well, so we ordered 2. The girls love the lights, and the shoes are adorable!
Love it!
So cute and sparkling~ my daughter's new favorite shoes
Shoes are super cute but when I received them only one shoe actually worked. I gave 4 stars for the quality and cuteness. Took one off because I got sent a faulty product!
my 4-year-old-girl loves it!
I love these! We've had several pairs over the past few years & they are well made, the lights last forever & are super cute! Would definitely recommend :)
We LOVE these shoes. I only wish they weren't so expensive. The LEDs on the toes are great. Our toddler loves running and stomping around to watch the lights. As such, she tends to not try and pull these off as some of her other sets!
I bought these shoes for my grand daughter in another state. She adored them!! My son sent a video of her stomping her feet to get the &#34;twinkle toes to light up!!&#34; Too cute! Only problem is Daddy said there was glitter EVERYWHERE!! I'm hoping once the &#34;New&#34; wears off it won't be a problem!! Fit was perfect!
Right shoe doesn't light up. What a disappointment! This is the gift I promise to give to a friend's kid for her birthday tomorrow. Now tomorrow I have to rush to mall to find such kind of lighting shoes to buy.
Great quality shoe!  My girls love them.
We have had these for months and they still look brand new.  That's a great accomplishment when my daughters playground is pea gravel.  Most shoes have ruined toes in a matter of weeks.  None of the sparkles have fallen off.  They still lit up, despite getting wet and covered in mud countless times.
My kid saw these on TV and loved them, she was due for some new comfortable shoes anyway. Didn't even know they had little LEDs on them til I got them, she totally loves these and wants to wear them all the time
very cute â˜º
Large to size. Cute...lite up and sparkle. Little girl loved these shoes.
Lights. Sequins. Bows. What 3 year old wouldn't love these?
Great shoe my daughter loves that they light up
These shoes are such a hit with my 4.5 year old daughter. She loves them and wears them for every activity, from preschool to playing at home. They're even fancy enough to wear during dress up! Colorful, fun, and well made.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the &#34;Sketchers&#34; label on the heel of this most recent pair is already peeling off after less than a week. They'd be just perfect without the label at all.
Only one shoe lights up not very happy with the product
I love them, but had to get a new pair  because only one shoe lit up.
Battery died too soon on 3 sets in one shoe each.
I love the look of these shoes.  Fun for the kids & my daughter was so excited to get her 1st pair of light up shoes but the left shoe light never worked from day 1 of the purchase.  My daughter has been frustrated trying to bang her foot to get it to turn on.  Haven't bothered with the hassle of returning yet but this was a big disappointment.
Cute, well made supportive sneakers.  And plenty wide for the wider feet.
My daughter LOVED these shoes. She usually wears a 71/2 i bought an 8 to allow room for growth. She cant get enough of the,
Great shoes perfect looking super cute and sparkly
These are as cute as can be!! Love to have found something in gold! My daughter is just under 2 & can easily pull the Velcro to pull them off herself. The shoes would be adorable even without the twinkling lights; their an added fun bonus for her.
My daughter loves them. & so do I she just turned 5!!
My granddaughter loves them
I love twinkle toes! Wish I could buy every pair!
Cute shoe but should come in wide, shoe is kinda tight, lights working fine and my daughter lived them. Definitely has to wear these with thin socks
My daughter (7) went out of her way to ask for these. Well, with school starting, she's in love with them. Arch support is decent, and she has flat feet, so needs that. They also leave out the frustration of laces, so these were a great pick for her. (Not to mention the lights! Also, even when the batteries run out, there is still plenty of use left in them because you can't tell they are supposed to light up...until they do!)
For my granddaughter's first day of kindergarten-  she loves, loves, loves them.
These look so cool and exactly as expected from sketchers but were way too large! Could have been simply my mistake for order too big.
Didn't buy on Amazon, but wanted to write a review.  My daughter loved them in the beginning.  She and her friends were making wishes on the them (with the music).  However, once she got to school the twinkle music was a bit distracting.  Teacher said that it wasn't too bad, so we went with it (some teachers I know would not like that).  Now she has only been wearing them a total of 2 weeks, the music (twinkle sound) goes off all by it-self!  When I bought them, the lady at the store said that there is an on and off switch, yes there is but only for the lights NOT the music.  The shoes are pretty and my daughter loves them but they have got to go back!
ðŸ˜Š
They look great and fit my son perfectly.
They are beautiful and give a different style to clothing.
nice shoes
Excellent product and love the colors.
Grandson loves them.
My Son adores these shoes :)  they are holding up very well for a 9 year old that is extremely hard on shoes..  I will buy this again :)
Bought these shoes for my son and he loves them... and the best part, they hold up to how hard he is on his shoes!
Kid loves them. Camo is really popular in his school so these fit the bill.
Do these shoes provide good arch support?
Ordered 3 pairs in different sizes for my 3 boys.  Held up! Wow.. would buy again.
Good price and delivered on time
I like these shoes for my son
School approved
good
Fits as expected. My son likes the shoe
My oldest grandaughter loved them wore them often and now passed them on to her 2 year old cousin who taps all around so they light. Still in use 2 kids !
My child's favorite shoes EVER
Love these shoes! Very comfortable!
Adorable! My 5 year old loves them
Beatifull
Love these shose
My son loves it.
We are no strangers to sketchers, and have never had any problems with them. However, this pair literally had problems with in the first week he had them. The orange on the side/sole just peeled away like cheap paint (?). Will give sketcher another chance, this may have been a fluke with his particular line.
The paint is wearing off after a week.
My son loves anything with the colour orange so I these shoes seemed fantastic when I ordered them. Also with no laces they are easy for kids to put on and take off by themselves. However within a week the orange colour as well as the black was coming off. These shoes didn't last very long at all through normal use by an active 4yo and the toe wore through faster than any other pair of shoes he has had. Skechers are normally pretty durable however this design didn't seem to last.
RECIEVED ON MARCH 19TH 2015 AND SHIPPED BACK TO AMAZON ON MARCH 25TH 2015. THE RUBBER IS PEELING OFF AND SO ARE STICKER. MY SONS WORN THEM TO SCHOOL 3 DAYS.....
My five year old son absolutely loves these shoes but the very first time he wore the the paint started chipping off around the rim of the rubber (where it meets the leather). It makes them look old and worn out fast but he just got them :(<br />I've bought myself Skechers many times and I've never had that happen to any of my shoes. I think it's just these shoes and its not the typical quality that I've received from Skechers.
Great fit and very comfortable.
Order them a 1/2 size small.
We thought they would be a little lighter. Otherwise they fit great!
Nice, but too big.
have not really worn as of yet, but look nice
Walkable attractive shoe for allday use.
I own a pair of these that I bought from a Sketchers store after ordering the &#34;my size&#34; online from Sketchers and found out they were too large.  I've had these shoes about a year and they have already started to fall apart.  The upper is separating from the sole on the right shoe  in the back and the heel failed months ago!  I love the look of the shoes and as much as it pains me, I may buy another pair simply because when they're closer to new, they are great feeling shoes even though they are heavy.  Very comfortable until the heels start to die.  This isn't my first set of Sketchers that have had the heel fail on them.  Kinda hard to fix that at shoesmith.
I thought they would Have been more support
Love them. Fit as I expected.
Love Sketchers! They always fit as expected and they are very stylish!
If my feet weren't so wide these would have been just about perfect.
These shoes are OK but have some faults. They do run a bit big. Also the insole is made of some kind of slick fabric that offers no grip to your sock so your foot slides around inside and with any kind of incline wants to slide right out the back. The sole is not thick enough to keep out the feel of pebbles or sticks you might be stepping on. I expected more from a name brand shoe.
These are  new favorite I wish Skechers made more of this style
For anyone who has had back surgeries, or suffers from sciatic pain, a clog is not the way to go.  It pulled on my hamstrings and put me in horrible pain for over a week, I had only worn them 2 days, and of course, the company would not give me a refund.
Very nice,comfy,feel cushy,great color combo.
Have white and black. Love them!
I love them---I have been wearing a pair that I purchased back in 2009 at JCPenney,; they are still in good shape, dirty;, but still wearable.  I bought the new pair cause I was embarrassed to wear the soiled pair, so, now I am wearing the old pair instead of buying bedroom slippers I use those and will wear the new pair when I go out shopping.<br />Thanks Skechers!!<br />Bubbi
Very cute shoes, my daughter can wear them with a lot of different outfits.  The glitter gets rubbed off the toe of the shoe very easily.  That was visible after she wore them twice and she is not rough on shoes.
My daughter loves her Bobs!
Pleased
excelente
They are skechers, love them!
very cute but not made too good for 5 year olds to keep on their feet all day, they dont stay on well
Pleased
Good Fit
A GIFT MUCH APPRECIATED
good
This is the second pair of these I have bought for my son.  He just loves them because they are so comfortable.  They also make an adult pair almost just like this that my husband has and really likes.
This shoe has  been discounted by the company, however it seems to be a popular demand amongst buyers. Can this be communicated to the manufacturer or dealers. Thanks
OK. Not really what I was looking for and they size too small.
thanks
heavy duty, well made...functional..
Fit as expected. Kids love them.
the case is fragile
I bought them for my husband, they are nice good material my only complain is i ordered a silver one but insted they send a black one
ok
Fits good.
I love these glasses. In fact this is the third pair I've bought. But they are scratched. The first pair i bought had a minor crack in the lense. About 1/8 of an inch. The second pair had minor scratches all over them and the third pair had one scratch on the lender by the noise piece.
They were a gift for my grandson and he likes them very much.
RECOMENDADO
very good
Very happy with these glasses. I have a big head and they fit great.
Good sunglasses
Nice glasses except for the fit. The arm on one side is curved too much so that there is pressure behind the ear.  Not bad enough to prevent wearing them but irritating when you put them on.  If not for that they would be five star.
Good glasses and they feel pretty light. The hinges however don't have a spring (another pair of Sketcher's glasses did). So I worry slightly that the hinges will hold up. The gradient lens is fairly pronounced which is good if that is what you expect.
excelente
I like the style, color, memory sole and rubber sole,  for arch support, I always add a small support<br />pad for better arch support.  Shoes in size 13 and more do not have good arch support regardless of<br />cost.  I use these shoes for daily walking.  They will be worn-out in less than 6 months.
Good fit. Look good. Husband says it's like walking on air. Time will tell if they hold up to how hard my husband is on his shoes.
So happy that I found these Sketchers in black and in my size.  I have a hard to find size and the Sketchers in the stores are way too expensive.  I bought two pairs and they fit great.  I wear them when I take my daily 30 minute walk.  The shoes are lightweight and provide great support.
It is very difficult for me to find shoes which have enough cushion in them to walk more than a couple of miles. I have old feet and knees and these are the best I have found.
thank you
The shiniest sneakers I've ever seen, they look like little kids shoes. The nylon on top is very thin, the rubber soles are poorly designed with strange slots in them that look like they'll split open the first time you wear them. Don't waste your money on these shoes.
Didn't last long before wearing out
Love these shoes for walking.  Mediocre for running, but at this price I am not complaining
Great shoe for an even better price.
Theg are already falling apart inside
Fits great but not meant for all day everyday wear they'll get worn out really quick, but for running they are perfect very comfortable, its like running on clouds
WASTED MONEY
Shoes arrived on time and good condition.  I've been wearing this model shoe for at least the last few pairs so I know what size to order, not sure how it compares to other manufacturers.  I wear them every day as they are my main footwear.  I'm not on my feet for most of the day, but when I work out or go for walks they are pretty comfortable.  With pretty rough and continual use, a pair usually lasts me between 6-10 months.  Pretty good for the price.
Excellent quality shoes with very good workmanship
love these shoes
I absolutely love these Sketchers and there's noway I can find a better price , I've tried looking and this was by far the best price and flawless quality , I have no complaints at all , I bought 3 pairs , that's how happy I am with the quality and the price
Great shoes. Very comfortable.
These shoes were too big. I had bought for my son who wears a size 12, and they were really big.He probably could have gone down to an 11, which he has not worn for a long time. They are very nice, they look very comfortable and very nice looking; too bad they did'nt fit. Sent back.
...you can not go wrong with these. At the posted price a real bargain for those that require satisfaction in their retail experience. At least at the end of the day you can say, &#34;Today,' I won the battle of the market place floor'. One down, a zillion more to go!
A bit more narrow on width and about a half size larger than other Sketchers shoes I own.  On smooth surfaces the little suction cups on the bottom make a popping noise.  People at work have commented on it.  I like the shoes, but have stopped wearing them to work for that reason alone.
These shoes are very light, comfortable and have held up so far. I haven't experienced the problem that other reviewers seem to have had with sqeaky soles even on smooth surfaces. I like the memory foam insoles and I've worn the shoes all day with no problems. For the price I didn't expect the shoes to be as nice as they are.
These were returned.  They seemed to be cut wrong in the left foot.  Seemed like outside of shoe was too high.  Also thought in general these ran a little large.
Squeaks!! when I walk. Loudly!!
My husband is very happy with these shoes! I hope they will last him longer than the cheap brands he had been wearing.
No
Boyfriend likes them alot! :)
Great price love them
My husband loves them. Said he never had a shoe fit so comfortable.
Nice design but it makes funny noises while walking. I don't recommend it.
These are great shoes for the price.  Yes, they do have octopus-like suckers on the soles which make a sucker sound on smooth surfaces...but not that annoying.
shoelace very short
Comfortable and well made. Will purchase again.
Like walking on air
Good shoe just wrong size.
The tread pattern is like a suction cup and they make a popping sound when walking on smooth floors.  It's pretty annoying.  Also my feet are a little wide and they are a little bit too narrow.  They would probably be fine for most people who don't buy &#34;wide&#34; shoes.  I like other Skechers I've had, but would not buy these again.
I like it!
Great job on the design....I enjoy walking around listening to the constant sound of &#34;suction cups&#34; from the poorly designed soles that have oval slits that allow air to get trapped when you step down. Then you get to hear the great sound of what sounds like suction cups as you lift your foot off the ground. WTF??? Seriously, when you manufactured these things, it didn't occur to you to actually test and evaluate them?
Only problem with these shoes is the toe pops when we go out walking. Both shoes do this and it is very annoying. Does not make for a quiet stroll around the neighborhood. Other than that love the shoes.
The shoe is uncomfortable to jog in. If you are looking for a shoe to walk around in, can use this for a bit but definitely not good enough for a long day.
These are great shoes!
I wear just wider than a D width but do not have to have Wides; And my ideal length size is 10.5 D/W. However, I have learned that an 11 D fits well in many cases for me. With this understanding, I order 11s. This shoe in the 11D fit well for me, are light weight, but I did need to add a small amount of arch support. This is not the fault of these Skechers per se, I have to add extra support on almost all shoes of all brands - on the recommendation of my doctor.  That said, these are very comfortable, light weight and breath well, which I am enjoying.
Bought these for my husband. He loves them.
True to size color is great really happy with them
I'm always looking for deals on Skechers because they never disappoint. The picture makes them look almost off black-They are black, but that's fine. These are actually even more comfortable than my other memory foam Skechers-SkechKnit, and they're made better too! No painted portions so you don't have to worry about what looks like paint chipping off.
light comfortable shoe
Soles are too firm for me personally, even though I love sketchers.  Sketchers has similar shoes with softer soles especially heels. The memory foam is nice just I have to put heel inserts in them to make them wearable.  In fair play I have back issues so I'm not a normal customer.
i just received these shoes in the mail, the memory foam cushion is more comfortable than the cushion in my other skechers that cost double, but the shell of the shoe is too tight for my feet, and even though i wear a normal 10.5, these were a bit tight for me around my toes. shoes come with black and white laces.they have a plastic mesh surface for breath ability, the mesh is thicker than the mesh on my nike running shoes i think is good, i feel too much of the wind through those shoes and it is only summer time
Thanks for the item.
These where too tight. I don't know why
Comfort number 1 on the list.  These are it.  Price is great and good shipping.  Non to complain about.
i love my skechers
good
Great summer shoes! Very comfortable. They are a little hot is the only down side. Great shoes!
These are the greatest shoes ever. I've worn Skechers in the past, as they typically fit my wide foot well without having to buy a &#34;wide&#34; width. I don't typically wear sneakers, and usually prefer boots, but I found myself in a Skechers outlet on a hot day. These seem to not come in half sizes, so I went a half size smaller, and they are the perfect fit without socks. These are also the only shoes I've ever had that are comfortable without socks. After wearing them for a few months, I bought two more pairs from Amazon. It seems like they are either sporadically available, or being discontinued (which I hope isn't the case).
My husband bought one pair of these and fell in love with the comfort and style.  He gets compliments on these whenever he wears them.  Since finding shoes that are both comfortable and stylish for him I reordered a couple pairs since finding shoes that he likes is difficult.  He is happy to have them on hand.
No arch support but I bought these for my husband and he seems to like them.
I received the product how i expeced
This is the second pair of these shoes I have owned. I wear them everyday around the house. They run about 1/2 size larger than most other shoes. Very comfortable. Very cool. I love them.
Excellent product.super comfortable shoes.
Bargain priced casual shoes that are comfy and fun.  Not good for running or long walks.
These shoes are super comfortable, available for my foot !, has a very well padded insole, which makes you feel super comfortable.
Sweet Shoes..
BACKGROUND:  I know Skechers is capable of making good shoes.  My significant other absolutely loves her Skechers Go-Walks.  I used to buy Skechers for my son growing up.  Skechers is supposed to be Nike's latest main competition.  My beloved New Balance 475 shoes were wearing out.  The replacement New Balance did not have the color or price that I wanted.  I tried finding an equivalent, ordered these.    They run larger and half-step sizes are not offered at the top of the size range (normally a 13 works for me, these are oversized even for that) and I couldn't get a half-size in my size. ( Ideally what I needed from them, if they offered it, was Size 12.5.)   Worse is they seem to have no arch support.  Me adding inserts to take up slack and add additional support do not seem to help.  These shoes are extremely well padded on the heel but so much that it almost pushes my whole body posture into a lean forward type position - even if I'm just walking or standing still.  I have to compensate, it's awkward, not comfortable.     SUMMARY:   I hate to say this but for my purposes, these are sloppy shoes, lacking support and agility.   Cosmetically they look &#34;OK&#34; but don't seem to have the quality of construction I have gotten used to with the New Balance shoes.  I will probably grudgingly wear these or obtain some better fitting / looking /construction shoes from another brand.  These Skechers will probably be relegated to gardening / dump run / painting type shoes.  I certainly wanted to like them.     SAVING GRACE?  I could say that the only saving grace for these shoes is, IF you are a &#34;heel striker&#34; with wide feet and you have an extreme sensitivity to impact, these ** might ** be your ticket?  But as far as &#34;steering&#34; your feet and agility - forget it.  They are sloppy boats in that regard.   They are not mega expensive compared to what's out there in Nike, New Balance, etc.    I notice that lately the New Balance shoes that I would be interested in are around $80 - $85.00.    As usual, you get what you pay for.   It's possible there are other models of Skechers in a higher class of shoe design but this purchase has left me ambivalent about trying anything else from this manufacturer.
nice pair of sneakers bought for working out at gym
Exactly as advertised. I really like the mesh for venting all around the shoe, my socks stay dry all day.
Excellent
Excelent!.good product and fair price. I am satisfied.
I needed a nice pair of running shoes to replace the ones I had taken to work and these shoes ended up being a great value and fit very well.
I was slightly skeptical about purchasing after reading a review where it was stated that the boots were difficult to put on and did not fit as expected.  Against this I purchased my actual size and was very please with the quality and fit.  It kept me very warm and I have only to wear regular socks in downwards of -35 degrees Celsius.  I gave a 4 star rating because the only con was that the outer like of the sole lifted slightly due to my excessive cleaning (using cloth and water).  I would definitely recommend this. Great quality and price.
My husband absolutely loves these boots.  He owns 4 pairs of them because he bought the available inventory after wearing out his first pair.  He is extremely picky with his feet (you have no idea), and always had to buy $400 boots (Red Wings), so I was quite surprised when I bought his first pair of these.  I bought them so he had a waterproof boot to wear on our ranch.  He liked them so much, he started wearing them to work.  (He is a general contractor in construction.)  NOTE:  They are not steel toed.  He usually puts 1-2 shoe pad things in ALL of his shoes for comfort.  He has NOT put any into these boots.  Every now and then when I see one of his pairs aside, I will wear them to feed the animals.  They have a very fitted, comfortable fit.  They come off easy and they go on easy EXCEPT when you have sweaty feet.  It takes a little muscle (for me) to get them back on if the boots are moist in any way.<br /><br />They are quite durable as well.  My husband will wear out a nice pair of steel-toed Red Wings in a year.  These boots last him about 10 months.  Keep in mind that this is only wear to his liking.  He wears out the toes from sliding/scooting on them.  I'm sure that they would last longer for someone who took better care of their stuff.<br /><br />I think these boots are being discontinued.  I do hope for the sake of my ears that this not the case.  These are the ONLY boots my husband has ever liked so much that he had me buy him more than 1 pair at a time.
Good boot for the price I paid for them.
Very happy with this purchase.
Comfortable and nice design.  Would buy if there were other colors.
sent them back
Super shoe.
My husband loves these and trust me it's hard to get him to like anything besides his steel tip work boots!<br />He said they are really comfy, fits perfectly and he loves to wear it when we are traveling because they are so easy to take off.<br />I am going to by another one for him.
Everything OK
Great shoes, at a great price. My husband loves them, but the fit was a little too large.
Good shoes. Comfortable
Great value, fast shipment, works as advertised and am happy with my purchase
These shoes are extraordinarily light and very comfortable.
Fell apart quick bad customer service
Awesome shoes!  They do fit a little loose, but that may simply be because I normally wear thicker socks with sneakers, but with these I wear very thin socks.  Very comfortable and stylish.
They're light as air and totally comfortable! I work on my feet all day and these are great!
Great pair of shoes. I have wide feet but these fit perfectly. They're nice enough to meet my office dress code, and casual enough to wear as my every day all-purpose shoe. I've had them since April 10, 2014 (It's August 28, 2015), wear them every day, and they're still holding up. About to order a 2nd pair, and a black pair as well, just in case they stop making them.
Right out of the box you are going to find these shoes to be one of the most comfortable shoes you have ever put on.  However, don't expect them to last that long.  If you wear them every day, they are going to wear out, both inside and out, very quickly.  Especially if you do a lot of walking on concrete.  BUT they are priced right and very comfortable shoes.
I purchased these before my overseas business trip to India.  I wanted something that would be comfortable in warm weather, worked with black or brown belt, would fit in an office, as well as a weekend outing. These are going strong nearly a year later with constant daily use Monday thru Friday. I will likely buy another pair once the padding wears out on these.  Still holding up fine so far.
Love Skechers very nice shoes
I bought these for Rick, he has worn Skechers in the past and really liked them. He was not crazy about the color, but he put them on and was able to start wearing them right away. He loves them. I wish I could find a pair of shoes that was that comfortable.
Very durable and comfortable. This is a great Buy
My go-to work shoe.
I wear these shoes two or three times a week for the entire day. They are very comfortable.
Great product.  I like the look and fit.
Very Comfortable to wear all day!
The product was better than i expected.
Kind of narrow but very com,fortable.
it is lightweight , good color... however ,no arch support! so sad..
just what I wanted
I bought them to wear to Poland.  Perfect!
very nice
Very comfortable.
As usual these new shoes live up to Sketcher's quality level and fit and finish. I got these on sale for $23. here and they are worth three times that. Stand on your feet or do a lot of walking? These cut the mustard.
I have always trusted Sketcher brand.  And, these are no different than any other pair I have worn.<br />Very comfortable and like the look as well.
nice
Very comfortable and light weight. Good value.
Nothing but Relaxfit sketchers will ever be on my feet again. Well except sandals in the summer. LOL
Really happy with purchase.  Great quality and great price.
Sturdy and attractive
Seems like the inside has broken down way fast I am on my feet all day at work and looking for a great pair of shoes thought with what I read online this would be them
Very good
Build quality sucks, but for the price ($35), it's OK
Quality and comfort.
Very nice shoes; just didn't work for my husband's needs.
If they did not have the &#34;ears&#34; around the Achilles tendon, they would be the best Sketchers I have ever owned.  They are roomy enough for my bunion, but not so loose my feet slide.  I wrote no arch support as I have flat feet and need to add a removable orthotic.
I bought two pairs of these for my husband.  He really likes them and they fit like any other Skechers that we have bought.
REALLY COMFORTABLE , I bought a pair of Dockers and also said that they had memory foam and wasn't truth, but this ones are really comfortable, with REAL MEMORY FOAM; they are wide enough to wear them all day; besides they bend easily and still maintain the shape no wrinkles that some times you get with use; I will buy another pair.
These Sketchers Artifact-Muster Oxford shoes are styles and comfortable. The fit is roomy with out being oversized. The leather material is a decent quality I wouldn't say top of the line leather but nevertheless a leather that looks and feels like leather. On the tag inside the shoe it says &#34;Leather Upper Balance Man Mad Material which from what I can tell from toughing and feeling the shoe part of the shoe is leather and the other part is man made leather. The stitching on the shoe is nice and well stitched. Inside  the shoe is cushiony from the sides and back of the thong to the memory foam foot bed. This stylish shoes in my opinion will pull together many casuals looks from jeans to kakis. definitely a nice addition to my shoe collection.
Making it 4 star due to lack of proper Arch support. I had to buy insoles to support the arch that I need. Everything else is absolutely fine. You can wear it for the day without any issues.<br /><br />If you are looking for better arch support, this might not work without proper insoles.
good fit and comfortable
The shoe it fine.  But, the outside parts of the show started to fade and fray very quickly.  I bought this same style in brown as well and they still look good.  But these black ones are very poor quality.  I'm almost embarrassed to wear them at work.
Exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly.
Very light weight and look nice. Came with an extra set of laces.<br />Slightly large, but I think it may be because of the &#34;relaxed fit&#34;. I may have been able to go a half size smaller.<br />Overall fairly comfortable.
Very comfortable!  If this pair lasts as long as my other Skechers I will be thrilled.
Great product and price! Highly recommend!
Good product. Good service
Excelent as expected
these r not the shoes I ordered  the box was all ripped up I am returning them as soon as I get a ride Because I'm handicapped and I don't drive. I did buy different brand of shoes and the shoes I bought  New Balance are great.  thanks Greg Troupe
Typically wear a size 11 but should have ordered an 11.5.
These were very good shoes.  Wore them for over a year with no issues.  Not as comfortable as some of the other Sketcher's models, but acceptable.
These are great sneakers.  Perfect fit and very comfortable.
Very comfortable shoe.  I have had them a few months now and they got the &#34;broke in&#34; feel rather quickly which i love!  I will be sticking with Skechers for the foreseeable future.
Great all around shoe comfortable and cool.
Garbage!
Comfortable shoes
Very comfortable
I always purchase Skecjers just for work and casual outing
I ended up returning.
Great
Great shoe.  Comfortable.  I had the Skechers' Diameter prior to purchasing this model,  but I definitely prefer the square toe of this model.  Good everyday shoe for the price.  Looks good with jeans,  but could be worn in business casual environment as well.
Good shoes so far
As expected
I don't wear socks in the summer and the inside of these shoes aren't finished off very smooth. There are seams that are open and it irritates my feet.
GREAT SHOES AND PRICE.I HAVE 5 PAIRS OF SKECHERS,ALL ARE GREAT
love it
Great driving shoes
I PURCHASE THIS ITEM ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER. HE SAYS IN THE LINE OF WORK HE DOES, THIS SHOES IS VERY COMFORTABLE/ DRESSY AND IDEAL FOR STANDING LONG PERIODS.
great competition. . .  beware Sperry
Like walking on a pillow.
Nice shoes.  I got these since they're allowable under the business casual rules where I work.  I find them comfortable and I do recommend.
My husband bought these shoes for work (he is on his feet a lot) and he finds them comfortable and sufficient for his needs.  He is not thrilled with the styling (hence the 4 stars), but for work they are just fine.
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had, and they are well-made.  You might want to go up a half-size or full-size, if your feet are wide across the end.  That's what I did, based on my dad's shoes.
I have a job that requires standing for 8-12 hours per day so I need comfortable supportive shoes and these Skechers are perfect for my work. This is my first experience with a memory foam insole and it is very spongy and you can feel it move up and down as you walk. These didn't require any break in period and were comfortable to wear out of the box. These feel lightweight and athletic enough to run in. I bought a Mens Size 9D and it fits as expected.
Other sketchers were recommended to me and I was able to try on another style. They felt great and I ordered these. They felt great at my work where I stand a lot. Took them on vacation (a lot of walking) these did great.
Excellent shoes as I walk an average of 15-17 miles per day and these shoes are perfect for my needs.  I have tried other major brands and they do not perform as these do.  I highly recommend these if you walk a lot.
the experience is fineï¼Œjust somewhat large
goodï¼
Good shoe but run about half size small.
Very good product
Was looking for Shape Ups but these are comfortable shoes and very light.
There Skechers just what I expected
Comfortable!
Very comfortable shoe.  Seems to be well constructed.
I Think they run a little smaller then they should, still a good product.
These shoes are worth the money for sure. I wanted other colors, but it looks like I found them as they were just about sold out.
A nice addition to my summer shoe collection. I'll be back and that's for sure.
Perfect summer time shoe. Very lightweight with lots of airflow. I was able to wear without socks on a hot day an did get any blisters.
Very comfy.wear it work daily
Nice shoes at a good price
Fantastic shoes. The memory foam feels really comfortable and the fit is just perfect.
These shoes were a little bit bigger than my other Skechers Wide work shoes, I don't mind the extra room and they are still very comfortable. What I don't like is that after 3 to 4 weeks they have started to fall apart. Both sides of my shoe have worn through the glue and peel up to reveal the bottom sole, which sucks when it's just a little bit wet outside. I loved my Skechers work boots, these sneakers I guess aren't built to the same quality. Went out and bought some Gorilla Glue and started gluing them back together.
good
Good shoes! Just a note - I find the all &#34;leather&#34; Skechers to be about a size smaller than they say they are. Example: If you wear an 11, get a 12. This is not the same as the cloth Skechers, which are pretty true to size. Even with a larger size, I find that these are a bit narrow, and &#34;low&#34;, as in the toe box touches the tops of my toes quite a bit. They will probably stretch out some though.
Great fit.
Very comfortable. Walked a mile in them the first time I wore them.
Not what I expected.
Like the style, but the fit is tight. Did not give much after wearing for 2 weeks
Comfy. Look good
I love the style and am hoping they stretch a bit with wear.  I can't really say they are too small in length, but the toe box seems a bit tight to me.  I used an insert to deal with blisters on my heels, and that is how I created the tighter situation in front.  Perhaps half inserts would be worth trying.
will give better review when I start wearing them
These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.
only had them for couple of weeks...I have wide feet and these only come in size D...I bought them because of the price.<br />surprisingly they are very comfortable.
I bought these for my man, and he really,really like them. He does ahve leg and back problems and when he first wore them he was like, &#34; I like these they feel like I'm walking on air&#34;. Now that's comfort for him. Thank you.
Good
Great deal and very comfortable
The quality of this shoe is horrible. The memory foam wore out after 1 week of wear. The loop at the heal broke the first time I tugged on it trying to put on the shoe. They squeak when walking. I'll probably use them for yard work.
Bought these for my brother's birthday. He loves them.
This shoe is one size bigger than normal so if you decide to buy, you will need to get it one size smaller, otherwise you will be returning it as I did.
Awesome, very soft and flexible Skechers.
After trying about all brands I've decided that Skecher's is the best shoe for me. I'm on my feet on concrete all day and this shoe never gives up. I pretty much have to get a wide size in other brands but the flex knit uppers make it possible to wear a medium Skecher's size and that makes a lot more choices available to me. I have many pairs of Skecher's shoes and highly recommend them even if you a not a runner.
most comfy shoes I've had in years., bad arches, hammer toes, planters fascitous, and ankel injuries, i need new feet, but theses shoes work for me.  I'm comfy all day at wok in them.
Feel good
It okay
Not the quality product as I expected.
I own a pair of this blue skechers go walk 2, although i did not buy them from amazon, rather from a physical store.. It has been way comfortable. i admire it, if makes me feel light and energetic. The material is cloth, so do not use it for walking in the rain or snow.  other than that, it is pretty cool.<br /><br />con:<br />It sometimes makes a noisy squeak like sound on wooden floors (MDF material)
I love these shoes in fact i have them on today....They are extremely comfortable...
Can't say enough about the Skechers products. They have always fit me like a pair of socks right out of the box. I guess I an one of the lucky ones when it comes to these shoes.
First off let me say that I've had several different pairs or many of the Go Run shoes over the years and this is the first time I've tried this Go Bionic Fuel,  they are awful.  All the other shoe lines are nice and flexible and made of a highly breathable material to keep your feet dry while out running.  Well not this pair, it is covered in a plastic material on about 50% of the shoe so my feet are warm and sweaty even while walking in them and they don't flex well at all, no wonder they were on sale for $25 (hopefully it's a discontinuation sale).  So needless to say I absolutely cannot use them as a running shoe, I brought them to work and figured they might be a decent work shoe at least.  Nope, they are hot as hell after just a couple hours of having them on.  Plus they are ugly as all hell compared to the other Go Run lines.
Shoes came on time and fit fairly well. Rt one is kinda snug and causing lil blister but that's not skechers fault .
Good shoe but for an avid runner - they don't last long.
i feel there is edge inside the shoes make it me Uncomfortable.
Very nice one i love skechers and nice delivery time
Like this shoe and its light.  True to size
its OK!
Good shoes for golfers.  Exceptionally comfortable.. for someone  who is fussy about the width of the shoes.  No issues with the golfer in my life.<br />Thank you!!
Very comfortable great golf shoes
Love them!
Nice golf shoes
My skethers look and feel good, however they don't breath. My feet got very warm and sweaty in 60 degree weather.
Great fit
Love these shoes. Very light but study that they don't develop holes or tear apart from use or change of direction.
I am embarrassed to write a review.  I bought the size like other running shoes but GORun4 are very narrow on the front. If I bought a half size bigger I will see a hole in the shoes pretty soon. So, the size I choose correctly. However, they are very lightweight shoes, but I did not feel comfortable during my 10K and Halfmarathon runs,  beacuse of the narrow front of the shoes. May they are very good, but not for me. Fortunately, I managed to resell it.
Skechers really out-did themselves with these shoes! They are extremely lightweight, flexible and comfortable with minimal, yet enough cushioning inside. I'm putting in miles I never imagined while wearing Nikes!
Light, comfortable (especially for my arthritic feet), excellent running shoe, good response yet softer. I have 2 other pair of these Sketcher performance division shoes. Bought originally because they were so comfortable fit my painful feet. Now that I'm running 13 miles each week they are all proving amazing.
I have been a Skechers GORun fan for 2.5 years now and these sneakers did not disappoint. They're light with a 4mm drop, which I like. I have worn these for marathon and ultra marathon distances and have had no problem. Just purchased a pair of the GORun Ride 4's for the first time. Hopefully they're as wonderful as these.
I am very happy with these shoes. I use them for longer runs and they are great. Quite light, very flexible wonderful fit.
very good
Really good road running shoes. I already have 400km of running wearing yen and I must say they still look like new. Perfect fit for my feet. They have become my training buddies and work excellent especially for speed workouts.
Hole cutout in back for &#34;easy slip on&#34; made my heels bleed when running without socks. Now the shoes are stained with blood. I reckon that I will have to wear socks with them from now on. They are still great running shoes, but that hole in the back. Some idiot on the board probably had to justify keeping it on the shoe to remain employed. Seriously, a giant hole in the back of the shoe? Really? I mean seriously? Feels bad man.
love it a lot. This is the best shoes to walk of running with.<br />thank you!
Terrible product barely a month and they have holes in the tops crappie materials used to make these 90 dollars wasted
Love these shoes. Sketchers are by far my favorite running shoes. Unfortunately they wear down way too quickly, but they are so great to run in, I will keep buying them. I've had all versions of this shoe and the 4th edition is a great update. They are more in line with the race shoes, but with more cushioning.
Great product. Perfect fit. Size is right on. Would recommend.
Both my husband and myself love them  it our 2nd pair each
Very welled cushioned. I like the snugger feeling of the GOrun3's at a size 11 better than the 4's. My feet don't hurt as much after a long run in the 4's, like the 3's.
fits perfect! Really nice looking shoe
I've had my Strada for about 3 weeks and have put 60 miles on them so far, while rotating with Saucony Kinvara 5 and Ride 6. The Strada have been a great addition to my rotation and after 14 miles today my legs and feet feel terrific. I have gotten blister on one toe consistently, but I blame that on my skinny get and the very humid temps I've been running in. I would highly recommend this shoe for those runs over 10 miles.
Fit and feel good
GOwalk 3's in the same size (11) are too tight in all independent stores and they don't carry 2's anymore or wide 3's. I want a mesh pair in black but the 2's are more expensive than the 3's.
I get up and walk at least 5 miles every morning. These shoes add no strain to the walk!
Great
These are the most comfortable shoes.  I now have 3 pairs.
Like them.
just a little tight in the toes.<br />pretty good for stylish, cheapo sketchers.<br />perfect for casual wear, not for all day or a lot of walking.
These Go Walk2's feel better then the new GoWalk 3.
Great product!!!!
I give this product a two star solely because the cushion inside the pulltab/collar is made so purely that everytime I slip my foot inside the cushion moves down which creates a bump. After the second or third wear I was always uncomfortable walking around as I always felt like there is something nudging the top of my heel. I love Sketchers but I am very very disappointed with this product.<br /><br />I only bought Go Bionic 2 because I have been wearing Go Bionic 1 for over 2 years non stop and loved how amazingly comfortable they felt on a daily use for work and exercise. They really got it wrong with this model and its heavily flawed. Please let Go Bionic 3 be flawless like the first one. I will wait for Go Bionic 3 and buy that for sure as Sketchers has only failed me once after purchased so many models.<br /><br />Note: If you look closely in the photos you will see how the pulltab/collar cushion inside the shoe has been pushed forward which made stop wearing them for good
Light weight,  great fit and would buy again.
There great enough said
I like the shoes
My #1 or #2 favorite go to running shoe at the moment. I can only run comfortably in zero drop or near zero drop shoes. GoBionic provides that, but in addition it gives _some_ cushioning. It is a happy medium between something like Altras, which have way too much cushioning for my taste despite being zero drop, and Skoras or NB Minimus (basically no cushioning). Excellent for medium and long runs. I will race my next marathon in them. Kudos to Skechers for producing a winner!!
Lightweight & comfortable for trail running (mid-foot strike). Good grip on trails, but haven't tried on any really aggressive trails. Optional (included) sole for extra padding is a nice feature.
This is my second pair of Sketchers.  I never would have associated the brand with good running shoes but I was dead wrong. Thanks to my wife for getting the first pair, which just blew me away for comfort.
If you are to use these for running,  make sure you transition into them slowly if you're not used to minimalist running.  I strained my calf muscle on two seperate occasions on a 3 mile run.  They are very light and comfortable for walking around.
I loved the original GoBionic trail running shoes and was so disappointed when they stopped making them. This updated model (which they appear to have stopped making now too) are, if anything, even better. I wear them for work because I am on my feet all day, so I can't comment on how good they are for running, but they are the most comfortable thing I've ever put on my feet, including slippers. I bought six pairs because I doubt they'll be available much longer.
The new Skechers Go Bionic 2 is my second go Bionic . I run in them very comfortably. These are the lightest running shoes on the market today . I ordered them from the US because in Poland I could not buy this model. I recommend to all .
These are by the far the most flexible trainers I've had in recent memory, so allow the feet to move in the way they are supposed to move, which for me is a massive plus. The toebox is a plus too, as it's thankfully roomy (and I have fairly wide feet). My main bugbear, and the reason I have docked a star, is that they do pick up stones due to the gaps on the sole. Quite why Skechers have never rectified this is beyond me.
Excellent
Very light and comfortable.
Great, light running shoes.  Warning: they soak up water through the sole since they &#34;breathe&#34;.  So, watch out for those puddles!
I've been wearing these Skechers Men's GOBionic 2 Running Shoes for about a month now.  I workout everyday and do a multitude of exercises including cardio (elliptical training, running, cycling, Pilates) and station weight training (Nautilus, free weights).  These shoes are great for everyday gym use.  They are comfortable, very light weight, and well ventilated.  The attached neoprene tongue is extremely comfortable and accommodates my foot shape without any break-in time.  The footbed is removable if you prefer a more minimalist running sneaker but I like the additional support and closeness of fit that the footbed provides when inside the shoe.  As with all of my athletic footwear, I replaced the laces provided with Lock Laces and much prefer that lacing system over standard laces as the elastic of the Lock Laces system flexes and gives with the movement of my feet.  Although running is not my primary training activity, I like the natural feel of GOBionics and the feedback I get from the running surface through the sole.  Very sensitive and natural feeling. I also like the price of Skechers as I purchase 4 to 5 pairs of running shoes each year due to over-use and shoe fatigue.  Great purchase from Amazon at a really great price!  If you like a less structured, natural feeling running shoe I recommend that you give them a try.  All-in-all I love these GOBionics!
Pls send me more often the lates product of skechers shoes
Purchased as a gift... Huge success.
Great marathon shoes!!!
I like the comfort and support that these shoes have. Very light weight and breathable. If I could change one thing about them it would be the flimsiness of the structure of the shoe itself. Doesn't feel like it will keep its form long. Good for walking or running but not for an everyday shoe, in my opinion.
Comfy and lightweight.  Pretty shiny..
I was hesitant to get these as they didn't fit the typical Sketcher Performance model. But wow, an excellent shoe. Did my first run in them at 13.5 miles. My feet were comfortable the entire run and they really helped me keep up my pace when I started to lag. And all my friends commented how cool they looked, so that was a fun bonus but for from my reason of buying them. They are a very different shoe for Sketcher. I highly recommend them even if you do not run because of comfort, anti fatigue factor and looks.
